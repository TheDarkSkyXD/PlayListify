## Implementation Notes

### Task Dependencies

- Tasks 1-3 should be completed first as they establish the foundation
- Tasks 4-6 can be worked on in parallel after the foundation is established
- Tasks 7-9 build upon the foundation and should be completed before advanced features
- Tasks 10-18 can be implemented incrementally and in parallel where appropriate

### Code Quality Standards

- All code must pass TypeScript compilation without errors
- Unit tests should achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- All public APIs must be documented with JSDoc comments
- Code must follow established linting and formatting rules
- Security best practices must be followed throughout implementation

### Testing Requirements

- Each task should include unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests should be added for IPC communication and file operations
- End-to-end tests should verify complete user workflows
- Performance tests should ensure startup and operation efficiency

### Documentation Requirements

- Each major component should have comprehensive documentation
- API interfaces should be documented with examples
- Configuration options should be clearly explained
- Troubleshooting guides should be provided for common issues

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for establishing a robust foundation for the Playlistify application, ensuring that all subsequent features can be built upon a solid, secure, and maintainable codebase.
