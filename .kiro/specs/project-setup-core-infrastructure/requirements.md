# Requirements Document: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

## Introduction

This spec covers Phase 1 of the Playlistify application development - establishing the foundational project structure, core infrastructure, and essential services that will support the entire application. This phase focuses on creating a robust, scalable foundation using Electron, React, TypeScript, and the specified tech stack.

Playlistify is an Electron-based YouTube playlist manager and downloader that gives users complete control over their YouTube content with features like playlist management, video downloading, offline playback, and health checking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Base Electron Project Setup

3. WHEN I build the project THEN it SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
4. WHEN I package the application THEN it SHALL create distributable files for the target platform
5. IF the main window is closed THEN the application SHALL terminate properly
6. WHEN the application is activated on macOS THEN it SHALL recreate the window if none exists

### Requirement 2: Project Structure and Directory Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices for Electron applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL have separate directories for frontend, backend, and shared code
2. WHEN organizing frontend code THEN it SHALL have dedicated directories for components, pages, stores, utils, and styles
3. WHEN organizing backend code THEN it SHALL have dedicated directories for services, utils, and IPC handlers
4. WHEN creating shared code THEN it SHALL have directories for types and constants
5. WHEN setting up assets THEN it SHALL have directories for icons, images, and public files
6. WHEN preparing for testing THEN it SHALL have organized test directories mirroring the source structure

### Requirement 3: Core Dependencies and External Tools Setup

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically manage its dependencies (yt-dlp and FFmpeg) so that I don't need to install anything manually on my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts for the first time THEN it SHALL check for required dependencies (yt-dlp and FFmpeg)
2. IF dependencies are missing THEN the application SHALL download them to a managed location within the app data directory
3. WHEN dependencies are downloaded THEN they SHALL be stored in platform-specific directories with proper permissions
4. WHEN the application needs to use yt-dlp or FFmpeg THEN it SHALL use the locally managed versions
5. IF dependency installation fails THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
6. WHEN the application is uninstalled THEN it SHALL clean up all downloaded dependencies

### Requirement 4: React and UI Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern React-based frontend with a comprehensive UI framework so that I can build an attractive and consistent user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the frontend THEN it SHALL use React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
2. WHEN configuring styling THEN it SHALL use TailwindCSS with a YouTube-inspired color scheme
3. WHEN implementing UI components THEN it SHALL use shadcn/ui as the primary component library
4. WHEN adding icons THEN it SHALL use lucide-react for consistent iconography
5. WHEN implementing routing THEN it SHALL use TanStack Router for navigation
6. WHEN managing server state THEN it SHALL use TanStack React Query for data fetching
7. WHEN implementing themes THEN it SHALL support both light and dark modes with proper color variables

### Requirement 5: Data Fetching and State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust data fetching and state management solutions so that the application can handle complex data flows efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring React Query THEN it SHALL have sensible defaults (5 minute stale time, no refetch on window focus)
2. WHEN implementing client-side state THEN it SHALL use Zustand for complex UI state that doesn't map to server state
3. WHEN defining data structures THEN it SHALL use comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in shared/types
4. WHEN handling loading states THEN it SHALL implement proper loading, error, and empty states
5. WHEN caching data THEN it SHALL use React Query's caching and invalidation strategies
6. WHEN synchronizing state THEN it SHALL properly sync between React Query and Zustand when needed

### Requirement 6: Persistent Storage and File System

**User Story:** As a user, I want my application settings and data to persist between sessions so that my preferences and configurations are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing user settings THEN it SHALL use electron-store with TypeScript type safety
2. WHEN managing file operations THEN it SHALL use fs-extra for enhanced file system utilities
3. WHEN organizing downloads THEN it SHALL create structured directory organization for playlists and videos
4. WHEN handling file paths THEN it SHALL properly validate and sanitize all file operations
5. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN it SHALL implement proper security measures
6. IF file operations fail THEN it SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback

### Requirement 7: IPC Communication Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a secure and type-safe communication system between the frontend and backend processes so that the application maintains security while enabling rich functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up IPC THEN it SHALL use contextBridge for secure communication between processes
2. WHEN defining IPC channels THEN it SHALL organize handlers by domain (app, downloads, files, playlists, settings, thumbnails)
3. WHEN implementing type safety THEN it SHALL use shared TypeScript interfaces for all IPC communication
4. WHEN handling errors THEN it SHALL properly propagate errors from backend to frontend with meaningful messages
5. WHEN registering handlers THEN it SHALL organize all IPC handlers in the main backend entry point
6. IF IPC communication fails THEN it SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and error recovery

### Requirement 8: Secure Preload Script Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a secure preload script that properly isolates the frontend from the backend while enabling necessary functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the preload script THEN it SHALL use contextIsolation and disable nodeIntegration
2. WHEN exposing APIs THEN it SHALL only expose necessary functionality through a controlled interface
3. WHEN handling security THEN it SHALL prevent direct access to Node.js APIs from the renderer process
4. WHEN implementing the API surface THEN it SHALL provide type-safe methods for all required operations
5. IF security violations are attempted THEN the system SHALL block them and log appropriate warnings
6. WHEN updating the API THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Requirement 9: Logging and Development Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and development tools so that I can debug issues and monitor application behavior effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL initialize a logging system that writes to both console and file
2. WHEN logging to file THEN it SHALL create timestamped entries in a dedicated Console Logs directory
3. WHEN a new session starts THEN it SHALL clear previous log files to ensure fresh logs
4. WHEN logging fails THEN it SHALL gracefully fall back to console-only logging without crashing
5. WHEN in development mode THEN it SHALL provide enhanced debugging capabilities
6. IF log directory creation fails THEN it SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue operation

### Requirement 10: Build System and Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust build system and development environment so that I can efficiently develop, test, and package the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Webpack THEN it SHALL properly handle TypeScript, CSS, and asset processing
2. WHEN setting up PostCSS THEN it SHALL integrate with TailwindCSS for optimal styling workflow
3. WHEN configuring development server THEN it SHALL support hot reloading and fast refresh
4. WHEN building for production THEN it SHALL optimize bundles and assets for best performance
5. WHEN packaging the application THEN it SHALL create platform-specific installers and distributables
6. IF build processes fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions for resolution
