# Requirements Document: Playlist Management & Local Storage

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for Phase 2 of the Playlistify application, focusing on comprehensive playlist management capabilities and robust local storage solutions. This phase builds upon the core infrastructure established in Phase 1 and introduces the primary user-facing features that enable users to create, import, organize, and manage their YouTube playlist collections.

The phase encompasses four major areas: playlist creation UI, YouTube playlist import functionality, comprehensive state management, and advanced playlist display capabilities. These features form the foundation of the user experience and establish the core value proposition of the application.

## Requirements

2. WHEN I create a custom playlist THEN the system SHALL require a title and allow an optional description
3. WHEN I enter playlist details THEN the system SHALL validate title uniqueness and enforce character limits (100 for title, 5000 for description)
4. WHEN I submit a valid playlist THEN the system SHALL create the playlist and display it in my collection immediately
5. WHEN I attempt to create a playlist with a duplicate title THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent creation
6. WHEN I interact with the creation interface THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback on validation status

### Requirement 2: YouTube Playlist Import

4. WHEN importing a playlist THEN the system SHALL handle private, unlisted, and deleted videos gracefully
5. WHEN the import process encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and recovery options
6. WHEN an import is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and allow cancellation

### Requirement 3: Local Storage and Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my playlist data to be stored locally and persist between application sessions so that my collections are always available.

6. WHEN storing playlist metadata THEN the system SHALL optimize storage efficiency while maintaining data completeness

### Requirement 4: Playlist Display and Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and organize my playlists in multiple formats so that I can efficiently browse and manage my collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view my playlists THEN the system SHALL provide both grid and list view options
2. WHEN displaying playlists THEN the system SHALL show thumbnails, titles, video counts, and last updated timestamps
3. WHEN I search for playlists THEN the system SHALL provide real-time filtering by title and description
4. WHEN I sort playlists THEN the system SHALL offer multiple sorting options (name, date created, date modified, video count)
5. WHEN I interact with playlist items THEN the system SHALL provide context menus with relevant actions
6. WHEN viewing large collections THEN the system SHALL implement efficient rendering to maintain performance

### Requirement 5: Playlist State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to efficiently manage playlist state so that the interface remains responsive and data stays synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playlist data changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI reactively without full page refreshes
2. WHEN multiple operations occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent state updates safely
3. WHEN network operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain application stability and provide recovery mechanisms
5. WHEN caching playlist data THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent cache invalidation strategies
6. WHEN synchronizing state THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency between UI state and persistent storage

### Requirement 6: Advanced Playlist Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform advanced operations on my playlists so that I can efficiently manage large collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select multiple playlists THEN the system SHALL enable batch operations (delete, export, duplicate)
2. WHEN I duplicate a playlist THEN the system SHALL create an exact copy with a unique name
3. WHEN I export playlists THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, CSV, M3U)
4. WHEN I import playlist data THEN the system SHALL validate format compatibility and handle conflicts
5. WHEN I merge playlists THEN the system SHALL combine videos while avoiding duplicates
6. WHEN I perform bulk operations THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and cancellation options

### Requirement 7: Playlist Metadata Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage detailed metadata for my playlists so that I can maintain comprehensive information about my collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I edit playlist details THEN the system SHALL allow modification of title, description, and custom tags
2. WHEN I add tags to playlists THEN the system SHALL support autocomplete from existing tags
3. WHEN I categorize playlists THEN the system SHALL provide folder-like organization capabilities
4. WHEN I track playlist statistics THEN the system SHALL maintain counts of total videos, duration, and last access
5. WHEN I set playlist privacy THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings for sharing and export operations
6. WHEN I backup metadata THEN the system SHALL include all custom fields and user-defined properties

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform efficiently even with large playlist collections so that my experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have hundreds of playlists THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive UI performance

- UI remains responsive with 1000+ playlists
- Data persistence reliability > 99.9%
- Search and filter operations complete within 500ms
