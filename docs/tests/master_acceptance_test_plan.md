# Master Acceptance Test Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the master acceptance test plan for the Playlistify project. It defines the strategy for high-level testing and specifies individual test cases with explicitly stated AI-verifiable completion criteria. This plan is based on the research report located in 'docs/research/', the user stories located in 'docs/specifications/user_stories.md', the high-level test strategy report located in 'docs/research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md', the project.md, and the docs/Mutual_Understanding_Document.md files.

## Overall Testing Strategy

The overall testing strategy for Playlistify is to ensure that the application meets the needs of its users and stakeholders, as defined in the user stories and other project documentation. This will be achieved through a combination of black-box, end-to-end acceptance tests that focus on observable outcomes.

The tests will be designed to verify the following aspects of the application:

*   **Functionality:** Does the application perform its intended functions correctly?
*   **Usability:** Is the application easy to use and navigate?
*   **Reliability:** Is the application stable and dependable?
*   **Performance:** Does the application perform efficiently and responsively?
*   **Security:** Is the application secure and protected from unauthorized access?

## Test Cases

The following are the initial set of high-level acceptance test cases for the Playlistify project. Each test case includes a description, preconditions, steps, and AI-verifiable completion criteria.

    3.  Save the playlist.
    4.  Verify that the playlist is displayed in the user's playlist list.
    5.  Edit the playlist name and description.
    6.  Save the changes.
    7.  Verify that the playlist is updated with the new information.
    8.  Delete the playlist.
    9.  Verify that the playlist is removed from the user's playlist list.
*   **AI-Verifiable Completion Criteria:**
    *   A new playlist is created in the database with the specified name and description.
    *   The playlist is associated with the user's account.
    *   The playlist is displayed in the user's playlist list.
    *   The playlist can be edited and updated with new information.
    *   The playlist can be deleted from the database and removed from the user's playlist list.

### Test Case 3: Song Search and Addition

*   **Description:** Verify that users can search for songs and add them to playlists.
*   **Preconditions:** The user is logged in to the application and has created a playlist.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Navigate to the song search page.
    2.  Enter a search query (e.g., song title, artist name).
    3.  Submit the search form.
    4.  Verify that the search results are displayed.
    5.  Add a song to the playlist.
    6.  Verify that the song is added to the playlist.
*   **AI-Verifiable Completion Criteria:**
    *   The search results are displayed based on the search query.
    *   The song is added to the playlist in the database.
    *   The song is displayed in the playlist's song list.

### Test Case 4: Playback Functionality

*   **Description:** Verify that users can play songs in a playlist.
*   **Preconditions:** The user is logged in to the application and has created a playlist with songs.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Navigate to the playlist page.
    2.  Select a song to play.
    3.  Verify that the song starts playing.
    4.  Verify that the playback controls (e.g., play, pause, skip) are functional.
*   **AI-Verifiable Completion Criteria:**
    *   The selected song starts playing.
    *   The playback controls are functional and allow the user to control the playback of the song.
    *   The song playback progress is displayed.

### Test Case 5: User Profile Management

*   **Description:** Verify that users can manage their profile information.
*   **Preconditions:** The user is logged in to the application.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Navigate to the user profile page.
    2.  Edit the user profile information (e.g., username, email, password).
    3.  Save the changes.
    4.  Verify that the user profile information is updated.
*   **AI-Verifiable Completion Criteria:**
    *   The user profile information is updated in the database.
    *   The updated user profile information is displayed on the user profile page.

## Test Environment

The acceptance tests will be performed in a test environment that closely mirrors the production environment. This will help to ensure that the application performs as expected when it is deployed to production.

## Test Execution

The acceptance tests will be executed by a team of testers who are familiar with the application and the testing process. The testers will follow the steps outlined in the test cases and record the results.

## Test Reporting

The results of the acceptance tests will be reported in a test report. The test report will include a summary of the test results, a list of any defects that were found, and recommendations for fixing the defects.

## AI Verifiability

Each test case includes explicitly stated AI-verifiable completion criteria. This ensures that the tests can be automated and that the results can be verified by an AI system. The AI system will be able to analyze the test results and determine whether the application meets the acceptance criteria.

## Future Test Cases

Future test cases will include tests for:
*   Sharing playlists with other users.
*   Collaborating on playlists with other users.
*   Importing playlists from other music services.
*   Exporting playlists to other music services.
*   Integration with social media platforms.
