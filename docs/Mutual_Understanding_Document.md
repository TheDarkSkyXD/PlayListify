## 1. Project Overview
Playlistify is a desktop application for managing and downloading YouTube playlists. It allows users to import playlists from YouTube, create custom playlists, download videos for offline playback, and organize their video library.

*   Watch YouTube playlists offline without ads.
*   Create and manage custom playlists from different YouTube channels.
*   Organize and archive YouTube content.
*   Automatically download new videos from favorite channels.

## 3. Target Users
*   **The Digital Archivist:** A user who wants to create a secure, permanent, and locally-controlled archive of YouTube content.
*   **The Convenience User:** A casual user who wants an easy way to download playlists and videos for offline access.

## 4. Key Features
*   Importing and managing YouTube playlists.
*   Downloading videos for offline playback.
*   Creating and managing custom playlists.
*   Organizing the video library.
*   Implementing Google OAuth2 authentication and accessing private playlists.
*   UI polish and improving the user experience.

## 5. User Stories
*   **Importing a playlist:** The user can initiate the import process in 3 clicks or less from the main screen.
*   **Downloading a video:** The user can start a download in 2 clicks or less, and clear progress information is displayed during the download.

## 6. Success Criteria
*   Number of playlists created and imported per profile.
*   Total number of videos successfully downloaded.
