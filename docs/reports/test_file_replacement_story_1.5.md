## 1. Summary

This report confirms the direct intervention taken to resolve persistent test failures related to **User Story 1.5: Search Within a Playlist**. Instead of a standard debugging cycle, the failing test files were completely overwritten with new, corrected versions as per the explicit instructions provided in the task.

This action was deemed necessary after multiple previous attempts to fix the tests failed. The new code is designed to be stable and correctly mock dependencies, addressing the root causes of the previous failures.

## 2. Files Modified

The following files were replaced in their entirety:

1.  [`tests/acceptance/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts`](tests/acceptance/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts)
2.  [`tests/edge_cases/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts`](tests/edge_cases/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts)

## 3. Rationale for Replacement

The previous versions of the tests suffered from two critical issues:

*   **Application Hang:** The tests would often cause the Electron application to hang on startup. This was traced to an unmocked network request (`/api/dashboard`) that the renderer process was making. The new test code correctly intercepts and mocks this request, preventing the hang.
*   **Test Instability (Race Conditions):** The tests were unreliable due to improper waiting for UI elements to be rendered and updated. The new code implements more robust waiting mechanisms and selectors, ensuring that Playwright waits for the UI to be in the correct state before performing actions or assertions.

## 4. Conclusion

The replacement of the failing test files with the provided corrected versions is complete. This action directly addresses the known issues and is expected to resolve all test failures for User Story 1.5. The test suite for this feature should now be stable and reliable.
