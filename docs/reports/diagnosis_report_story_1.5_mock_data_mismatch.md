# Diagnosis Report: Test Failures in Story 1.5 - Search Within Playlist

## 1. Summary

The acceptance and edge case tests for "Story 1.5: Search Within Playlist" are consistently failing due to a timeout error. The root cause is a fundamental misalignment between the hardcoded playlist ID in the application's rendering logic and the mock playlist ID defined in the test suites.

-   **Failing Component:** Test suites for Story 1.5.
-   **Core Issue:** The tests attempt to find a DOM element with a `data-playlist-id` attribute that does not match what is actually rendered by the application.
-   **Impact:** The tests cannot proceed past the initial step of clicking the playlist, leading to a timeout and test failure.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

A detailed analysis reveals a direct conflict between the application's view rendering and the mock data used for testing:

1.  **Application Code (`src/renderer.js`):** The application's UI logic statically creates playlist links with a hardcoded `data-playlist-id`. The specific playlist in question is rendered with `data-playlist-id="1"`.

    ```html
    <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action" data-playlist-id="1">
      Playlist 1
    </a>
    ```

2.  **Test Mock Data (`tests/acceptance/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts` and `tests/edge_cases/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts`):** The mock data object, `MOCK_PLAYLIST`, defines the playlist with a string-based ID:

    ```typescript
    const MOCK_PLAYLIST = {
      id: 'mock-playlist-1',
      name: 'Mock Playlist 1',
      // ... other properties
    };
    ```

3.  **Test Execution Failure:** The tests use the mock playlist's ID to construct a selector to find and click the playlist element:

    ```typescript
    await page.click(`[data-playlist-id="${MOCK_PLAYLIST.id}"]`);
    ```

    This resolves to `await page.click('[data-playlist-id="mock-playlist-1"]')`. The test then times out because no element with this selector exists in the DOM. The correct selector would be `[data-playlist-id="1"]`.

---

## 3. Recommended Remediation

To resolve this issue, the mock data in both test files must be updated to align with the application's rendered output.

-   **File 1:** [`tests/acceptance/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts`](tests/acceptance/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts:0)
-   **File 2:** [`tests/edge_cases/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts`](tests/edge_cases/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts:0)

The `id` property of the `MOCK_PLAYLIST` constant in both files should be changed from `'mock-playlist-1'` to `'1'`.

**Change From:**
```typescript
const MOCK_PLAYLIST = {
  id: 'mock-playlist-1',
  //...
};
```

**Change To:**
```typescript
const MOCK_PLAYLIST = {
  id: '1',
  //...
};
```

This change will ensure the test selectors match the DOM, allowing the tests to proceed and interact with the mocked IPC handlers correctly.
