# Diagnosis Report: Syntax Error in Edge Case Tests

**File:** [`tests/edge_cases/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts`](tests/edge_cases/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts)

## 1. Summary

This report details the diagnosis and resolution of a critical `SyntaxError` in the edge case test file for "Story 1.5: Search within Playlist". The error was caused by an incorrectly nested `test.describe` block, which corrupted the test suite's structure and prevented Playwright from executing the tests.

## 2. Diagnosis

- **Problem:** A `test.describe` block was located inside a `test` block. This is invalid Playwright syntax, as `describe` blocks cannot be nested within individual `test` blocks.
- **Root Cause:** The error was introduced during a previous file modification, likely a copy-paste or merge error, which resulted in a duplicated and misplaced `describe` block.
- **Impact:** The entire test file was un-runnable, failing at the parsing stage with a `SyntaxError`.

## 3. Resolution

- **Action Taken:** The corrupted file was completely rewritten to restore the correct structure.
- **Details:**
    1.  The erroneously nested `test.describe('Input-Based Edge Cases', ...)` block was removed.
    2.  The test suite was restructured to have a single, top-level `test.describe('Edge Case Tests for Story 1.5: Search within Playlist', ...)` block.
    3.  All category-specific `describe` blocks (`Input-Based`, `Data-Based`, `UI/Interaction`) were made direct children of the top-level `describe` block.
    4.  The `beforeEach` hook was updated to include the navigation logic to the specific playlist page, simplifying individual tests by removing redundant setup code.
    5.  All `test` blocks were verified to be correctly placed within their respective category `describe` blocks.

## 4. Outcome

The file [`tests/edge_cases/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts`](tests/edge_cases/story_1.5_search_within_playlist.spec.ts) is now syntactically correct and ready for execution. The test structure is logical and adheres to Playwright best practices.
