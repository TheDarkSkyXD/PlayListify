# Patterns Identified - Arc 1: Robustness and Security

This document summarizes the patterns identified from the research on robust and secure dependency management solutions for yt-dlp and FFmpeg in an Electron application.

*   **Static binaries are a common solution for dependency management:** Several sources suggest using static binaries to simplify installation and reduce dependency conflicts.
*   **Security is a major concern:** There are many potential security vulnerabilities in Electron applications, including XSS, misconfigurations, and supply chain attacks.
*   **Secure API key management is crucial:** API keys should be stored securely and rotated regularly to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Dependency management requires careful planning:** It's important to minimize the number of dependencies, establish a patching plan, and use a reliable package manager.
