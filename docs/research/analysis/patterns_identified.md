# Analysis: Patterns Identified from Arc 1 Research

This document outlines the key patterns and high-level strategies that have emerged from the initial research into local-first media library management (Arc 1).

## Pattern 1: Decoupling Metadata from Storage

A dominant pattern across all researched areas is the principle of decoupling the application's metadata from the physical storage of media files.

*   **Description:** The SQLite database should act as the single source of truth for all information *about* the media (playlist titles, video metadata, relationships, file paths, etc.). The file system, in contrast, is treated as a simple, content-addressable storage system for the media files themselves.
*   **Implication:** This separation of concerns creates a more resilient and flexible system. The user-facing organization can be changed (e.g., renaming a playlist) by simply updating a database record, with no need to touch the file system. Similarly, the physical storage location of files can be optimized for performance (e.g., using a hashed directory structure) without affecting the logical organization presented to the user.

## Pattern 2: Proactive Performance and Integrity Configuration

A second major pattern is the need to be proactive in configuring the chosen technologies for performance and data integrity, as their default behaviors may not be optimal for this application's use case.

*   **Description:** Neither SQLite nor the underlying file system are inherently optimized "out-of-the-box" for a high-performance media library.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **SQLite Foreign Keys:** The default behavior is to *not* enforce foreign key constraints. The application must explicitly execute `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;` on every connection to prevent data corruption.
    *   **SQLite Indexing:** While SQLite creates some indexes automatically, a proactive and query-driven indexing strategy is required to ensure the application remains responsive as the library grows.
    *   **File System Performance:** Storing thousands of files in a single directory is known to cause performance degradation. A hashed, nested directory structure must be proactively implemented to prevent this bottleneck.

## Pattern 3: Design for Common Operations

The research indicates that the design of both the database schema and the file system should be driven by the most common operations the user will perform.

*   **Description:** The application is expected to be read-heavy (browsing, searching, playing) rather than write-heavy (importing, downloading). Therefore, design choices should prioritize the speed and efficiency of these read operations.
*   **Implication:** This pattern justifies the performance trade-off of using indexes (slower writes for much faster reads) and informs which specific indexes to create (on columns used for searching, filtering, and sorting).
