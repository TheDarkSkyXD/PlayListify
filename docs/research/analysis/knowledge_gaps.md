# Knowledge Gaps - Arc 1: Robustness and Security

This document summarizes the remaining knowledge gaps from the research on robust and secure dependency management solutions for yt-dlp and FFmpeg in an Electron application.

*   **Specific implementation details for secure API key storage:** While several strategies for secure API key storage have been identified, the specific implementation details for each strategy need to be further explored.
*   **Impact of specific Electron misconfigurations on security:** Further research is needed to understand the impact of specific Electron misconfigurations on security and how to mitigate these risks.
*   **Best practices for dependency patching in Electron applications:** More research is needed to determine the best practices for dependency patching in Electron applications, including how to automate the process and ensure that patches are applied in a timely manner.
*   **Concrete steps to ensure integrity and authenticity of binaries:** What are the concrete steps we can take to ensure the integrity and authenticity of yt-dlp and FFmpeg binaries?
