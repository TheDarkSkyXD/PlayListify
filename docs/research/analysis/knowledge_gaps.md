# Analysis: Knowledge Gaps and Adaptive Reflection

This document identifies the remaining unanswered questions after the initial deep dive into Arc 1 (Local Media Library Management). It also contains the adaptive decision on how to proceed with the research.

## Identified Knowledge Gaps

The initial research has provided a strong foundation for the database schema and file system structure. However, several specific, practical questions remain unanswered:

1.  **Metadata Storage Strategy:**
    *   **The Gap:** The research has not yet determined the *optimal* strategy for storing metadata. The primary options are:
        1.  Store all metadata exclusively in the SQLite database.
        2.  Store metadata in JSON "sidecar" files next to the media.
        3.  Embed metadata directly into media files (e.g., ID3 tags).
    *   **Why it Matters:** The choice has significant implications for performance, data portability, and the complexity of the application. For example, embedding tags makes the media files self-contained but is much slower and more complex to implement than a simple database write.

2.  **Database Migration Strategy:**
    *   **The Gap:** While the `project.md` file implies an evolving application, there is no research yet on how to handle database schema migrations in an Electron app using `better-sqlite3`.
    *   **Why it Matters:** Without a clear migration strategy, any future changes to the database schema (e.g., adding a new column) would risk breaking the application for existing users or requiring them to delete their local database.

3.  **Transaction Management for Bulk Operations:**
    *   **The Gap:** The research on indexing highlighted the performance cost of writes. However, it did not investigate the use of database transactions to optimize bulk operations.
    *   **Why it Matters:** When importing a large playlist, wrapping all the individual `INSERT` statements for videos and the junction table into a single transaction could provide a massive performance boost (potentially orders of magnitude). The best practices for this in `better-sqlite3` need to be investigated.

## Adaptive Reflection and Decision

**Decision:** The initial research plan to investigate three distinct arcs remains valid and robust. The knowledge gaps identified above are not fundamental flaws in the initial strategy but rather represent a need for a more granular, implementation-focused level of detail within the existing arcs.

*   The "Metadata Storage Strategy" and "Transaction Management" gaps fall squarely within **Arc 1**.
*   The "Database Migration Strategy" is a cross-cutting concern but is most closely related to the data persistence focus of **Arc 1**.

Therefore, the decision is to **proceed with the original multi-arc research plan**. No new arcs are required at this stage. The identified knowledge gaps will be the primary focus of the **Phase 4: Targeted Research Cycles**. The next immediate step will be to formulate specific queries to address these gaps, starting with the metadata storage strategy.
