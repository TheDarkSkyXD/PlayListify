# Contradictions Identified (First Pass: Arc 1)

*This document records any contradictions or conflicting information found during the research process.*

## First Pass Analysis (Arc 1)

As of the initial research pass for Arc 1: State Management & Persistence, no significant contradictions have been identified. The findings from different sources are largely complementary and point towards a consistent set of best practices.

*   The emphasis on **write-through caching** for data integrity (Finding 1.4) and the use of **atomic transactions** (Finding 1.1) are mutually reinforcing concepts.
*   The high-level **Persistent Queue Pattern** (Finding 1.2) is a practical application of the lower-level **Transactional State Machine** pattern (Pattern 1).
*   The **IPC Push-based Synchronization** pattern (Pattern 4) is the standard and uncontradicted architecture for Electron apps using a backend database.

This document will be updated if future research in other arcs reveals conflicting information.

## Second Pass Analysis (Arc 2)

No significant contradictions were identified during the research for Arc 2. The patterns for resilience build logically on the state management patterns from Arc 1.

*   The concept of **checkpointing** (Finding 2.1) is a more granular implementation of the **hybrid caching** strategy (Pattern 3), where progress is the data being flushed to disk.
*   The use of a **busy timeout** (Finding 2.3) is a specific, low-level implementation detail that supports the overall goal of a resilient **Transactional State Machine** (Pattern 1).
*   **State-Driven Recovery** (Pattern 5) and the **Idempotent Consumer** (Pattern 6) are complementary patterns that work together to enable safe retries of interrupted tasks.

## Third Pass Analysis (Arc 3)

No direct contradictions were found during the research for Arc 3. The findings on concurrency and scalability are consistent with the patterns established in the previous arcs.

*   The recommendation to use a **task queue for I/O-bound work** (Finding 3.1) aligns perfectly with the **Service-Layer Abstraction** pattern (Pattern 2).
*   The use of **WAL mode** (Finding 3.4) is a direct and necessary enhancement to the **Transactional State Machine** (Pattern 1) to ensure the UI remains responsive (Pattern 4) during background writes.
*   The patterns for **dependency management** (Finding 3.2, 3.3) are logical extensions of the core task schema and do not conflict with any previous findings.
