# Contradictions - Arc 1: Robustness and Security

This document summarizes the contradictions identified from the research on robust and secure dependency management solutions for yt-dlp and FFmpeg in an Electron application.

*   **Static binaries vs. package managers:** Static binaries simplify installation but may increase application size and require manual updates, while package managers automate dependency management but require users to have the package manager installed.
*   **Security vs. convenience:** Secure API key management practices can add complexity to the development process and may impact user convenience.
