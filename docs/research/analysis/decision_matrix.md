# Decision Matrix - Arc 1: Robustness and Security

This document provides a decision matrix for evaluating different dependency management and security solutions for the PlayListify project.

## Criteria

*   **Security:** How well does the solution protect against security vulnerabilities?
*   **Usability:** How easy is the solution to implement and use?
*   **Maintainability:** How easy is the solution to maintain and update?
*   **Performance:** How does the solution impact the performance of the application?
*   **Cost:** What is the cost of implementing and maintaining the solution?

## Solutions

| Solution                      | Security | Usability | Maintainability | Performance | Cost |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Static Binaries               | High     | Medium    | Medium          | Medium      | Low  |
| Package Managers              | Medium   | High      | High            | High        | Low  |
| Server-Side Proxy             | High     | Low       | Medium          | Low         | Medium |
| node-keytar                   | High     | Medium    | High            | Medium      | Low  |
| Electron's `safeStorage` API | Medium   | High      | High            | Medium      | Low  |

## Analysis

Based on the decision matrix, the best solution for PlayListify will depend on the specific requirements and priorities of the project. If security is the top priority, then using a server-side proxy or node-keytar may be the best option. If usability is the top priority, then using package managers or Electron's `safeStorage` API may be the best option. A combination of solutions may be necessary to achieve the desired level of security and usability.
