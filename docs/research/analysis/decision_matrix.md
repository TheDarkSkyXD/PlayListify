# Decision Matrix: Research Arc Evaluation

*This document provides a systematic evaluation of the three research arcs investigated, measured against the primary criteria for a successful task management service.*

## Evaluation Criteria

1.  **Reliability:** How well does the arc's focus contribute to a system that is robust, consistent, and guarantees data integrity?
2.  **Resilience:** How well does the arc's focus contribute to the system's ability to recover from crashes and handle errors gracefully?
3.  **Performance:** How well does the arc's focus contribute to a system that is fast, responsive, and avoids bottlenecks?
4.  **Simplicity:** How complex are the patterns and solutions proposed within the arc to implement and maintain? (Lower score is better).

## Scoring

*   **1:** Poorly addresses the criterion.
*   **2:** Partially addresses the criterion.
*   **3:** Adequately addresses the criterion.
*   **4:** Strongly addresses the criterion.
*   **5:** Comprehensively addresses the criterion.

| Research Arc                                           | Reliability | Resilience | Performance | Simplicity | **Total Score** |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | :---------: | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: | :-------------: |
| **Arc 1: State Management & Persistence**              |      5      |      3     |      3      |      4     |     **15**      |
| **Arc 2: Resilience, Error Handling, & Recovery**      |      4      |      5     |      3      |      3     |     **15**      |
| **Arc 3: Concurrency, Dependencies, & Scalability**    |      3      |      3     |      5      |      2     |     **13**      |

## Analysis & Conclusion

The decision matrix reveals that **Arc 1 (State Management)** and **Arc 2 (Resilience)** are the most critical pillars for the success of this project, scoring equally high.

*   **Arc 1** scored highest on **Reliability** and **Simplicity**. Its patterns (atomic transactions, clear schema) form the non-negotiable foundation of a trustworthy system. Without this, nothing else matters.
*   **Arc 2** scored highest on **Resilience**. Its patterns (checkpointing, idempotency, recovery) are what elevate the system from a simple queue to a robust service that can be trusted with long-running, important tasks.
*   **Arc 3** scored highest on **Performance**, but lowest on **Simplicity**. Its patterns (concurrency models, dependency graphs, WAL mode) are crucial optimizations, but they are layered on top of the foundation provided by Arcs 1 and 2. The complexity score reflects that implementing these correctly requires more intricate logic.

**Conclusion:** The research confirms that all three arcs are essential, but they have a clear, logical dependency on one another. A successful implementation must prioritize the findings from **Arc 1** first, followed immediately by **Arc 2**, and then optimize with the findings from **Arc 3**. This sequence ensures that the system is built on a reliable and resilient foundation before advanced performance tuning and complex features are introduced. The integrated model presented in the synthesis phase is a direct result of this conclusion, layering the concepts from the three arcs in their logical order of importance.
