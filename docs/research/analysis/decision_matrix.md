# Analysis: Decision Matrix

This document provides a systematic evaluation of the three primary research arcs against the core architectural requirements of the Playlistify application. The purpose of this matrix is to justify the integrated model by showing how each arc contributes to a balanced and robust final design.

The core criteria are:
*   **Performance:** How does the approach affect the application's speed and responsiveness, especially as the user's library grows?
*   **Security:** How does the approach protect user data and the application from common vulnerabilities?
*   **Maintainability:** How does the approach affect the long-term health of the codebase, making it easier to debug, update, and extend?

| Research Arc | Key Technologies | Performance | Security | Maintainability | Synthesis & Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Local Media Library Management** | `better-sqlite3`, `fs-extra`, Migration Tools | **High** | **Medium** | **High** | **Adopted.** The use of a transactional database with proper indexing and a hashed file structure provides the best possible performance for a local-first application. The high maintainability comes from a structured schema, automated migrations, and the decoupling of metadata from storage. |
| **2. Robust Video Downloading & Conversion** | `yt-dlp`, `p-queue`, `ffmpeg` | **High** | **N/A** | **Medium** | **Adopted.** The combination of `yt-dlp`'s powerful format selection and a priority-based queue from `p-queue` ensures an efficient and responsive download experience. Maintainability is medium, as it requires careful management of external binaries and their command-line arguments. |
| **3. Secure API Integration & Settings** | `electron-store`, `safeStorage`, `contextBridge` | **High** | **High** | **High** | **Adopted.** This arc is non-negotiable from a security standpoint. Using the OS-native `safeStorage` and a locked-down IPC bridge (`contextBridge`) provides the highest level of security with no significant performance penalty. The resulting code is highly maintainable due to the clear separation of concerns and type-safe API contract. |

## Conclusion

The decision matrix clearly shows that the strategies identified in all three research arcs are not mutually exclusive but are, in fact, complementary and essential for building a high-quality desktop application. The final integrated model is a direct result of combining the "best-of-breed" solutions from each arc.

*   **Arc 1** provides the performant and maintainable **data foundation**.
*   **Arc 2** provides the powerful and efficient **core functionality**.
*   **Arc 3** provides the essential **security wrapper** that protects the application and its users.

By adopting the key findings from all three arcs, the resulting architecture will be performant, secure, and maintainable, meeting all the primary goals of the research phase.
