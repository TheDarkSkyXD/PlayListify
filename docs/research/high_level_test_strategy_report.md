# High-Level Test Strategy Report for Playlistify

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive high-level testing strategy for the Playlistify application. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that the application meets the needs of its users, functions correctly, and is reliable and secure. The tests described in this report are designed to be AI-verifiable, meaning that they can be automated and their results can be checked by an AI agent.

## 2. Scope

This test strategy covers the following key areas of the Playlistify application:

*   Project Foundation & Playlist Viewing (Epic 1)
*   Custom Playlist Management (Epic 2)
*   Core Downloading & Offline Playback (Epic 3)
*   Background Tasks & Activity Center (Epic 4)
*   Playlist Health & Status Sync (Epic 5)

## 3. Testing Principles

The following principles will guide the testing process:

*   **User-centricity:** Tests will be based on user stories and acceptance criteria.
*   **Automation:** Tests will be automated to the greatest extent possible.
*   **AI-verifiability:** Tests will be designed to be easily verified by an AI agent.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests will cover all key features and functionalities.
*   **Continuous Integration:** Tests will be integrated into the continuous integration pipeline to ensure that they are run automatically with each build.

## 4. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will consist of the following types of tests:

*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** These tests will simulate real user workflows, starting from the application's entry point and going through all the necessary steps to complete a task.
*   **Acceptance Tests:** These tests will verify that the application meets the acceptance criteria defined in the user stories.
*   **Integration Tests:** These tests will verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.
*   **Component Tests:** These tests will verify that individual components of the application function correctly.

### 4.1 End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests will be used to verify the most important user workflows. These tests will be automated using a tool like Selenium or Cypress.

**Example E2E Test:**

*   **Workflow:** Import a playlist from YouTube, download a video, and play it offline.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Launch the application.
    2.  Click the "+ Add" button.
    3.  Select "Add Playlist".
    4.  Enter a valid YouTube playlist URL.
    5.  Click the "Import" button.
    6.  Wait for the playlist to be imported.
    7.  Select the imported playlist from the sidebar.
    8.  Click the "Download" button for a video in the playlist.
    9.  Wait for the download to complete.
    10. Click the downloaded video to play it.
    11. Verify that the video plays correctly.
*   **AI-Verifiability:** An AI agent can verify each step by inspecting the application's UI, checking for the presence of specific elements (e.g., the "+ Add" button, the "Import" button), and verifying that the video plays correctly.

### 4.2 Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests will be used to verify that the application meets the acceptance criteria defined in the user stories. These tests will be automated using a tool like Cucumber or Jest.

**Example Acceptance Test:**

*   **User Story:** As a user, I want to see the main application window with the sidebar and top navigation bar so that I can understand the layout and see the main sections of the app.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The application opens to a primary window within 2 seconds.
    *   A persistent sidebar is visible on the left, taking up no more than 20% of the screen width.
    *   A persistent top navigation bar is visible at the top, with a height no more than 10% of the screen height.
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  Launch the application.
    2.  Verify that the application window opens within 2 seconds.
    3.  Verify that a sidebar is visible on the left and that its width is no more than 20% of the screen width.
    4.  Verify that a top navigation bar is visible at the top and that its height is no more than 10% of the screen height.
*   **AI-Verifiability:** An AI agent can verify each step by inspecting the application's UI and measuring the dimensions of the sidebar and top navigation bar.

### 4.3 Integration Tests

Integration tests will be used to verify that different parts of the application work together correctly. These tests will be automated using a tool like Jest or Mocha.

**Example Integration Test:**

*   **Modules:** Playlist Import Service, Database
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  Call the Playlist Import Service to import a playlist from YouTube.
    2.  Verify that the playlist is added to the database.
    3.  Verify that the videos in the playlist are added to the database.
*   **AI-Verifiability:** An AI agent can verify each step by inspecting the database and checking for the presence of the playlist and videos.

### 4.4 Component Tests

Component tests will be used to verify that individual components of the application function correctly. These tests will be automated using a tool like React Testing Library or Jest.

**Example Component Test:**

*   **Component:** VideoPlayer.tsx
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  Render the VideoPlayer component with a valid video URL.
    2.  Verify that the video player loads and displays the video.
    3.  Verify that the play button works correctly.
    4.  Verify that the pause button works correctly.
    5.  Verify that the volume slider works correctly.
*   **AI-Verifiability:** An AI agent can verify each step by inspecting the component's UI and checking that the video plays correctly and that the controls function as expected.

## 5. AI Verification Strategy

To ensure that the tests are AI-verifiable, the following strategies will be used:

*   **UI Inspection:** The AI agent will inspect the application's UI to check for the presence of specific elements, their properties, and their states.
*   **API Monitoring:** The AI agent will monitor the API calls made by the application to verify that they are correct and that the responses are as expected.
*   **Database Inspection:** The AI agent will inspect the database to verify that data is being stored and retrieved correctly.
*   **Log Analysis:** The AI agent will analyze the application's logs to identify any errors or warnings.

## 6. Test Automation Framework

The following tools and technologies will be used to automate the tests:

*   **Test Runner:** Jest
*   **UI Testing:** Selenium or Cypress
*   **Component Testing:** React Testing Library
*   **AI Verification:** A custom AI agent or a third-party AI testing tool

## 7. Conclusion

This high-level testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality of the Playlistify application. By following these guidelines, the development team can create a reliable, secure, and user-friendly application that meets the needs of its users. The focus on AI-verifiability will enable the team to automate the testing process and ensure that the application is continuously tested and improved.
