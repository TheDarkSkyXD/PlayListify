# Key Research Questions: Arc 2 - Resilience, Error Handling, and Recovery

This document outlines the central questions for Arc 2. This research arc focuses on ensuring the task management system is robust and can gracefully handle and recover from unexpected failures, such as application crashes or database issues.

### Core Questions:

1.  **Crash Resilience:** What are the standard industry patterns for making task execution resilient to application crashes or unexpected shutdowns in a desktop environment?
    *   *Sub-question:* Explore the concepts of task journaling (logging intentions before acting) and checkpointing (periodically saving progress) as they apply to a local SQLite-based system. What are their implementation costs and benefits?

2.  **Database Failure Handling:** How can the system gracefully handle database connection failures, deadlocks, or `SQLITE_BUSY` errors during a critical task update?
    *   *Sub-question:* What are the recommended retry mechanisms (e.g., exponential backoff) for database operations within a task's lifecycle?

3.  **Task Recovery on Startup:** What are the most effective strategies for identifying and resuming "unfinished," "stale," or "interrupted" tasks upon application startup?
    *   *Sub-question:* How does the service reliably determine if a task was interrupted mid-execution versus being genuinely queued? (e.g., using a "running" status with a heartbeat or timeout mechanism).
    *   *Sub-question:* What are the potential pitfalls of automatically resuming tasks, and how can they be mitigated?

4.  **Idempotency:** What are the best practices for designing and implementing idempotent tasks to prevent duplicate processing if a task is unintentionally retried after a failure?
    *   *Sub-question:* How can a unique task identifier be used to ensure that an operation (like a download) is only performed once, even if the "start download" command is received multiple times?
