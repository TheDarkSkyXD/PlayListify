# Key Research Questions: Arc 1 - State Management & Persistence Patterns

This document outlines the central questions that will guide the research for Arc 1. The focus of this arc is to understand the most effective and reliable methods for managing and persisting task state in a local database environment.

### Core Questions:

1.  **Task State Persistence:** What are the most effective strategies for ensuring the consistent and reliable persistence of task state (e.g., queued, running, failed, completed, canceled, retrying) in a local SQLite database?
    *   *Sub-question:* How can atomic operations be guaranteed when updating task states to prevent race conditions or partial updates?

2.  **Database Flushing Strategies:** What are the pros and cons of different flushing strategies for updating task status and progress in the database, especially in the context of a desktop application?
    *   *Sub-question:* Compare write-through caching (immediate database write) vs. write-back caching (batching updates) in terms of performance, data integrity, and complexity for this use case.

3.  **Schema Design:** What are the best practices for designing the schema of a `tasks` table in SQLite to support efficient querying, status reporting, hierarchical relationships (parent/child tasks), and future extensibility?
    *   *Sub-question:* What data types are optimal for storing statuses, progress, timestamps, and serialized metadata (`details` JSON blob)?
    *   *Sub-question:* Which columns should be indexed to optimize common queries, such as finding all "unfinished" tasks or querying tasks by status?

4.  **Source of Truth:** How should the system balance in-memory state caching (e.g., for the Activity Center UI) versus relying solely on the database as the single source of truth?
    *   *Sub-question:* What are the trade-offs between performance (reading from memory) and data consistency (reading from disk)?
    *   *Sub-question:* What patterns can be used to keep the in-memory cache synchronized with the database without excessive polling?
