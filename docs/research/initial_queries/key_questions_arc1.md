# Key Questions - Arc 1: Robustness and Security

This research arc focuses on dependency management and security aspects of the PlayListify project.

Key questions to be addressed:

*   What are the most robust and secure dependency management solutions for yt-dlp and FFmpeg in an Electron application?
*   What are the potential security vulnerabilities associated with downloading yt-dlp and FFmpeg locally?
*   How can the application handle user data and API keys securely?
*   What are the specific security threats and mitigation strategies for Electron applications relevant to PlayListify?
*   How can we ensure the integrity and authenticity of yt-dlp and FFmpeg binaries?
*   What are the licensing implications of using yt-dlp and FFmpeg, and how can we ensure compliance?
*   How can we minimize the risk of supply chain attacks related to dependencies?
*   What are the best practices for securely storing and managing API keys used by the application?
