# Research Scope Definition

This research project investigates the best practices, architectural patterns, and technical strategies for developing a local-first YouTube playlist management and downloader application using Electron. The primary context is derived from the `project.md` blueprint, which outlines a technology stack including `yt-dlp`, `better-sqlite3`, `React`, and `TypeScript`.

The research will be conducted across three distinct but interconnected arcs:

1.  **Local Media Library Management:** This arc focuses on the persistent storage and organization of playlist metadata, video files, and user data. It will explore the optimal use of `better-sqlite3` for relational data, strategies for managing a file-based library of downloaded media, and best practices for handling metadata synchronization.

2.  **Robust Video Downloading and Format Conversion:** This arc will delve into the implementation of a resilient and efficient video download system. Key areas of investigation include the effective use of `yt-dlp-wrap`, managing download queues with `p-queue`, handling format conversion with `ffmpeg`, and implementing adaptive quality selection based on user preferences and video availability.

3.  **Secure Credential Handling and API Integration:** This arc addresses the security and integration aspects of the application. It will research best practices for securely storing user settings and API credentials using `electron-store`, interacting with the YouTube Data API via `googleapis`, and establishing secure, type-safe Inter-Process Communication (IPC) channels within an Electron application.

The outcome of this research will be a comprehensive set of documents that will inform the SPARC Specification phase, providing a solid foundation for high-level acceptance tests and the primary project plan.
