# Arc 3: Key Questions for Secure API Integration & Settings

This research arc focuses on the secure handling of user data, API credentials, and the communication pathways within the Electron application.

1.  **Settings & Credential Management (`electron-store`):**
    *   What are the best practices for securely storing sensitive data, such as OAuth refresh tokens for the YouTube API, using `electron-store`? Should encryption be used, and if so, how should the encryption key be managed?
    *   How should the application structure its settings schema to be both flexible for future additions and type-safe?
    *   What is a robust strategy for handling settings migrations if the schema changes in a future application update?
    *   Where should `electron-store` save its data to ensure it persists correctly across application updates and is compliant with OS-specific guidelines (e.g., AppData on Windows, Application Support on macOS)?

2.  **YouTube API Integration (`googleapis`):**
    *   What is the most secure and user-friendly OAuth 2.0 flow for a desktop Electron application to get permission to access a user's YouTube playlists?
    *   How can the application efficiently use the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch playlist data while respecting API quotas and minimizing costs? What are the best practices for using `fields` parameters and caching responses?
    *   What is the proper way to handle token expiration and refreshing using the `googleapis` library in a long-running desktop application?
    *   How should the application handle API errors gracefully, such as quota exceeded, permission denied, or playlist not found?

3.  **Secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**
    *   What are the most current and secure patterns for exposing backend functionality to the frontend renderer process in Electron, using a `preload.ts` script?
    *   How can a type-safe IPC contract be established and maintained between the frontend and backend to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience?
    *   What specific validation should be performed in the main process on all data received from the renderer process via IPC channels to prevent security vulnerabilities?
    *   How can the application provide granular, context-aware feedback to the user (e.g., toasts, modals) based on the success or failure of an IPC operation?
