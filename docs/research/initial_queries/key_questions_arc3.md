# Key Questions - Arc 3: AI-Verifiable Testing Strategy

This research arc focuses on creating a concrete plan for AI-verifiable tests for the PlayListify project.

Key questions to be addressed:

*   How can we effectively automate testing with AI agents?
*   What specific metrics and criteria should be used for AI-verifiable tests?
*   What existing AI testing tools and techniques are available?
*   How can UI inspection, API monitoring, database inspection, and log analysis be used to create AI-verifiable tests?
*   What are the best practices for designing tests that are easily verifiable by an AI agent?
*   How can we ensure that the AI agent can accurately interpret the results of the tests?
*   How can we use AI to generate test cases automatically?
*   How can we use AI to analyze test failures and identify the root cause of the problems?
