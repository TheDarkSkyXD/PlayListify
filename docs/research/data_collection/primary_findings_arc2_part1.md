# Primary Findings - Arc 2: User Experience Optimization - Part 1

This document summarizes the primary findings from the research on UI/UX design and detailed functional requirements of the PlayListify project, considering the use of Shadcn components.

## Shadcn Components

*   Shadcn UI is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform.
*   Shadcn components are designed to be accessible and customizable.
*   It's important to ensure that the components are used correctly and that the application as a whole is accessible.

## UI/UX Design Best Practices

*   Usability best practices for desktop applications should be followed, especially regarding accessibility.
*   Specific UI elements should be avoided or adapted to better suit a desktop environment compared to YouTube's design.
*   The UI should be optimized for users with disabilities.

## Functional Requirements

*   High-level user stories should be decomposed into smaller, more manageable tasks with specific acceptance criteria.
*   Clear, measurable success criteria should accompany each functional requirement.
*   Test-Driven Development (TDD) should be effectively integrated into the development process to ensure that functional requirements are met.
*   Key user flows within the application should be streamlined for optimal user experience.
*   The application should provide clear and intuitive feedback to the user during long-running tasks such as downloading and importing playlists.
