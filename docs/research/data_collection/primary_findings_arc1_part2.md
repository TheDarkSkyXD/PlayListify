# Primary Findings - Arc 1: Robustness and Security - Part 2

This document summarizes specific implementation details for secure API key storage in an Electron application.

## Secure API Key Storage Implementation Details

*   **node-keytar:**
    *   Use `node-keytar` to store API keys in the operating system's credential store.
    *   The API key is encrypted using a key derived from the user's login password or system credentials.
    *   This approach protects the API key from being accessed by other applications or users with full disk access.
    *   Example implementation:
        ```javascript
        const keytar = require('keytar');
        const serviceName = 'Playlistify';
        const accountName = 'youtube-api-key';

        async function storeApiKey(apiKey) {
          await keytar.setPassword(serviceName, accountName, apiKey);
        }

        async function retrieveApiKey() {
          return await keytar.getPassword(serviceName, accountName);
        }

        async function deleteApiKey() {
          await keytar.deletePassword(serviceName, accountName);
        }
        ```
*   **Electron's `safeStorage` API:**
    *   Use `safeStorage` to encrypt and decrypt the API key before storing it on the local machine.
    *   This API uses the operating system's built-in encryption mechanisms.
    *   This approach protects the API key from being accessed by other applications or users with full disk access.
    *   Example implementation:
        ```javascript
        const { safeStorage } = require('electron');
        const key = 'encryption-key';
        const encryptedApiKey = safeStorage.encryptString(apiKey);
        localStorage.setItem('api-key', encryptedApiKey);

        const decryptedApiKey = safeStorage.decryptString(localStorage.getItem('api-key'));
        ```

*   **Storing API keys on a server:**
    *   Create a server-side proxy that handles API requests and keeps the API key secret.
    *   The Electron application sends requests to the proxy server, which then forwards the requests to the API provider.
    *   This approach prevents the API key from being exposed to the client.

## Ensuring Integrity and Authenticity of yt-dlp and FFmpeg Binaries

*   **Provide hashes for release binaries:** Distribute hashes together with the binaries to ensure that what is being downloaded is also what has been built by your pipeline.
*   **Code Signing:** Employ code signing to guarantee the source and integrity of the executable files.
*   **Dependency Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI to ensure that files fetched from CDNs or third-party sources haven't been tampered with.
