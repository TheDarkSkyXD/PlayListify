# Secondary Findings - Arc 1: Robustness and Security - Part 1

This document summarizes the secondary findings from the research on robust and secure dependency management solutions for yt-dlp and FFmpeg in an Electron application.

## Dependency Management Solutions

*   **Lightweight frameworks:** Consider using lightweight frameworks like Tauri and NW.js to reduce the size and complexity of the application.
*   **Yarn package manager:** Use Yarn instead of npm for more stable dependency trees and to clean node_modules.
*   **Electron as a development dependency:** Manage Electron as a development dependency to streamline the deployment process.

## Security Considerations

*   **Minimize the number of dependencies:** Each dependency adds to the size and complexity of the application and can introduce security vulnerabilities.
*   **Adopt secure software development best practices and perform security testing:** This helps to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Ensure no native OS level RCE:** Check to ensure that there is no ability for native OS level RCE within the Electron app.
*   **Establish a dependency patching plan:** Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
