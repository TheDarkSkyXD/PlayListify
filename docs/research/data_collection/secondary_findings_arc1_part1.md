## Finding 1.S1: Optimal Transaction Type for a Task Queue

While SQLite transactions are fundamental (Finding 1.1), the *type* of transaction used has a significant impact on how concurrent writes are handled. For a task queue with multiple workers, `IMMEDIATE` transactions are superior to the default `DEFERRED` mode.

*   **`DEFERRED` (Default):** A lock is not acquired on the database until the first read or write operation occurs. If two processes begin a deferred transaction and then both attempt to write, one will receive a `SQLITE_BUSY` error immediately.
*   **`IMMEDIATE`:** A `RESERVED` lock is acquired on the database as soon as the `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` command is executed. This signals the process's intent to write. If another process holds a write lock, this command will honor the `busy_timeout` (Finding 2.3), waiting and retrying to acquire the lock. It effectively serializes the writers, preventing them from failing instantly and forcing them into a queue.
*   **`EXCLUSIVE`:** This is similar to `IMMEDIATE` but acquires an `EXCLUSIVE` lock, preventing other processes from even reading from the database. This is generally too restrictive for a task queue where a UI might need to read state concurrently.

**Conclusion:**

For the task management service, all write operations should be wrapped in an `IMMEDIATE` transaction. This provides the best balance of performance and concurrency handling, allowing SQLite to queue incoming write requests gracefully when used in conjunction with a busy timeout.

**Implementation with `better-sqlite3`:**
The `transaction()` function in `better-sqlite3` creates a function that, when called, wraps all its contents in a transaction. By default, it uses `DEFERRED`. To change this, you simply pass the transaction type as a string:

```javascript
const writeTask = db.transaction((details) => {
  // ... all database statements here
});

// To execute:
writeTask(taskDetails); // This will run inside BEGIN IMMEDIATE...COMMIT
```
No, that's incorrect. `better-sqlite3`'s `transaction()` method does not accept a string to change the type. It returns a function that you can call with `.deferred()`, `.immediate()`, or `.exclusive()`.

Correct Implementation:
```javascript
const writeTask = db.transaction((details) => {
  // ... all database statements here
});

// To execute:
writeTask.immediate(taskDetails); // Correctly uses BEGIN IMMEDIATE
```
