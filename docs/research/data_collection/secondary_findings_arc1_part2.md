# Secondary Findings - Arc 1: Robustness and Security - Part 2

This document summarizes secondary findings related to specific implementation details for secure API key storage in Electron applications.

## Secure API Key Storage Implementation Details - Secondary Findings

*   **Electron's `safeStorage` API - Security Semantics:**
    *   macOS: Encryption keys are stored for your app in Keychain Access in a way that prevents other applications from loading them.
    *   Windows: Uses CryptProtectData, which uses the user's login credential to encrypt the keys.
    *   Linux: Encryption keys are stored with libsecret.
*   **Importance of a server-side proxy:** Even with client-side encryption, it's often recommended to use a server-side proxy to handle API requests. This prevents the API key from being exposed to the client and allows for rate limiting and other security measures to be implemented on the server.
*   **Limitations of Electron Vault:** While Electron Vault can encrypt a key, it may not be suitable for all scenarios, as it's not possible to secure your source code in Electron.
*   **Alternatives to Electron's `safeStorage`:** Tauri, a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications, offers the stronghold plugin as an alternative to Electron's `safeStorage`.

## Electron Misconfigurations and Security Impact - Secondary Findings

*   **Electronegativity:** This tool can be used to identify misconfigurations and security anti-patterns in Electron applications.
*   **Common Web Vulnerabilities:** Common web vulnerabilities can also exist on Electron applications, hence it is highly recommended to adopt secure software development best practices and perform security testing.
*   **Poor Electron configuration deployments can lead to real problems, like client-side RCE:** This should be a big focus of any Electron app security review.

## Best Practices for Dependency Patching in Electron Applications - Secondary Findings

*   **Use a current version of Electron:** Updating Electron to the latest version ensures that any previous/known vulnerabilities are already patched and cannot be exploited in your application.
*   **Evaluate your dependencies:** Choose trusted 3rd-party libraries and avoid outdated libraries affected by known vulnerabilities or relying on poorly maintained code.
*   **Use patch-package:** This tool allows you to fix NPM dependencies instantly.

## Ensuring Integrity and Authenticity of yt-dlp and FFmpeg Binaries - Secondary Findings

*   **Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP):** A CSP can help prevent the execution of untrusted code in the application.
*   **Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities:** Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   **Monitor application logs for suspicious activity:** This can help detect tampering or malicious activity.
