# Detailed Findings - Arc 1: Robustness and Security - Part 3

This document presents the detailed findings from the research on robust and secure dependency management solutions for yt-dlp and FFmpeg in an Electron application.

## Secondary Findings

*   **Lightweight frameworks:** Consider using lightweight frameworks like Tauri and NW.js to reduce the size and complexity of the application.
*   **Yarn package manager:** Use Yarn instead of npm for more stable dependency trees and to clean node_modules.
*   **Electron as a development dependency:** Manage Electron as a development dependency to streamline the deployment process.

## Security Considerations

*   **Minimize the number of dependencies:** Each dependency adds to the size and complexity of the application and can introduce security vulnerabilities.
*   **Adopt secure software development best practices and perform security testing:** This helps to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Ensure no native OS level RCE:** Check to ensure that there is no ability for native OS level RCE within the Electron app.
*   **Establish a dependency patching plan:** Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

## Ensuring Integrity and Authenticity of yt-dlp and FFmpeg Binaries

*   **Provide hashes for release binaries:** Distribute hashes together with the binaries to ensure that what is being downloaded is also what has been built by your pipeline.
*   **Code Signing:** Employ code signing to guarantee the source and integrity of the executable files.
*   **Dependency Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI to ensure that files fetched from CDNs or third-party sources haven't been tampered with.

## Secure API Key Storage Implementation Details - Secondary Findings

*   **Electron's `safeStorage` API - Security Semantics:**
    *   macOS: Encryption keys are stored for your app in Keychain Access in a way that prevents other applications from loading them.
    *   Windows: Uses CryptProtectData, which uses the user's login credential to encrypt the keys.
    *   Linux: Encryption keys are stored with libsecret.
*   **Importance of a server-side proxy:** Even with client-side encryption, it's often recommended to use a server-side proxy to handle API requests. This prevents the API key from being exposed to the client and allows for rate limiting and other security measures to be implemented on the server.
*   **Limitations of Electron Vault:** While Electron Vault can encrypt a key, it may not be suitable for all scenarios, as it's not possible to secure your source code in Electron.
*   **Alternatives to Electron's `safeStorage`:** Tauri, a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications, offers the stronghold plugin as an alternative to Electron's `safeStorage`.
