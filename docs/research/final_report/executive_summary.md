# Final Report: Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a comprehensive research initiative into the best practices for developing a local-first YouTube playlist management and downloader application. The research, guided by the Multi-Arc and Adaptive Research methodology, was conducted to inform the SPARC Specification phase for the Playlistify project.

The investigation was structured around three distinct research arcs:
1.  **Local Media Library Management:** Focusing on database and file system architecture.
2.  **Robust Video Downloading:** Focusing on `yt-dlp` integration and queue management.
3.  **Secure API Integration:** Focusing on data security and Inter-Process Communication (IPC).

**Key Findings & Recommendations:**

The research concludes that a successful application architecture must be built on a foundation of **decoupling metadata from physical storage**. The **SQLite database must serve as the single source of truth**, with its performance and integrity assured through the mandatory use of **transactions for bulk operations** and a **dedicated migration library** for schema management.

For the core downloading functionality, the research recommends a robust set of **`yt-dlp` command-line arguments** to ensure reliable downloads and metadata embedding. This process should be managed by a **persistent, priority-based download queue** to provide a responsive user experience.

On the security front, the findings are unequivocal: all sensitive data, particularly OAuth tokens, must be encrypted using Electron's native **`safeStorage` API**. Furthermore, all communication between the application's frontend and backend must be strictly controlled through a **secure IPC bridge**, implemented via a `preload` script and the `contextBridge` API, to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

The integrated architectural model presented in this report, which synthesizes the findings from all three research arcs, provides a clear and robust blueprint for development. By adhering to these research-backed recommendations, the Playlistify project can proceed with a high degree of confidence in its architectural soundness, security posture, and long-term maintainability.
