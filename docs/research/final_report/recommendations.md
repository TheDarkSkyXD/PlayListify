# Recommendations - Arc 1: Robustness and Security

Based on the research findings and analysis, the following recommendations are made to the PlayListify team:

1.  **Adopt a multi-layered approach to security:** Implement a combination of security measures, including secure coding practices, security tools and frameworks, and regular dependency updates.
2.  **Prioritize secure API key management:** Use node-keytar or Electron's `safeStorage` API to store API keys securely and implement a server-side proxy to handle API requests.
3.  **Implement a robust dependency management process:** Minimize the number of third-party integrations, establish a patching plan, and use a reliable package manager.
4.  **Ensure the integrity and authenticity of binaries:** Provide hashes for release binaries and employ code signing.
5.  **Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing:** This will help to identify and address any remaining security vulnerabilities.
6.  **Establish a security incident response plan:** This will help the team to respond quickly and effectively to any security incidents.
