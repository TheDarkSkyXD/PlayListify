# Final Report: Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive research and analysis conducted, this section presents the final recommendations for the Playlistify application's architecture and development plan.

## 1. Adopt the Integrated Architectural Model

The primary recommendation is the formal adoption of the **Integrated Architectural Model** synthesized from the research findings. This model, which is detailed in the `synthesis/integrated_model.md` document, provides a robust, secure, and performant blueprint for the application.

Its core tenets are:
*   A **database-driven architecture** with SQLite as the single source of truth.
*   A **decoupling of logical data from physical file storage**.
*   A **secure-by-default posture**, enforced by the Electron Context Bridge and OS-level credential management.

## 2. Implement the Practical Application Checklist

The second recommendation is to use the **Practical Applications and Development Tasks** checklist, detailed in the `synthesis/practical_applications.md` document, as the initial, high-level project plan for the implementation phase.

This checklist translates the architectural principles into a concrete set of actionable tasks, ensuring that the key research findings are directly applied during development. The checklist covers all three research arcs:
*   **Arc 1 Tasks:** Focus on correctly setting up the database, migrations, and file system.
*   **Arc 2 Tasks:** Focus on building the core download and queue management functionality.
*   **Arc 3 Tasks:** Focus on implementing the essential security measures for settings and IPC.

By following these two core recommendations, the development team can proceed with a high degree of confidence that the application is being built on a solid, well-researched foundation that prioritizes performance, security, and long-term maintainability.
