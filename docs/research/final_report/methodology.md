# Methodology - Arc 1: Robustness and Security

This research followed an adaptive, multi-arc methodology to investigate robust and secure dependency management solutions for yt-dlp and FFmpeg in the PlayListify Electron application. The research process consisted of the following phases:

1.  **Knowledge Gap Analysis and Multi-Arc Strategy Formulation:** Defined the scope of the research and identified key questions to be addressed.
2.  **Persona-Driven Research Execution and Recursive Abstraction:** Adopted the persona of a 'PhD Researcher' to execute research for the first arc, formulating specific queries for the AI search tool and documenting findings in the `data_collection` folder.
3.  **First-Pass Analysis and Adaptive Reflection:** Analyzed the collected data, noted initial patterns and contradictions, and documented unanswered questions and areas needing deeper exploration in the `analysis` folder.
4.  **Targeted Research Cycles:** Executed targeted research cycles to address the identified knowledge gaps, integrating the new findings back into the `data_collection` folder.
5.  **Synthesis and Final Report Generation:** Adopted the persona of a 'Professor' to synthesize all validated findings into human-understandable documents, including an integrated model, key insights, and practical applications.
