# Detailed Findings - Arc 1: Robustness and Security - Part 4

This document presents the detailed findings from the research on robust and secure dependency management solutions for yt-dlp and FFmpeg in an Electron application.

## Electron Misconfigurations and Security Impact - Secondary Findings

*   **Electronegativity:** This tool can be used to identify misconfigurations and security anti-patterns in Electron applications.
*   **Common Web Vulnerabilities:** Common web vulnerabilities can also exist on Electron applications, hence it is highly recommended to adopt secure software development best practices and perform security testing.
*   **Poor Electron configuration deployments can lead to real problems, like client-side RCE:** This should be a big focus of any Electron app security review.

## Best Practices for Dependency Patching in Electron Applications - Secondary Findings

*   **Use a current version of Electron:** Updating Electron to the latest version ensures that any previous/known vulnerabilities are already patched and cannot be exploited in your application.
*   **Evaluate your dependencies:** Choose trusted 3rd-party libraries and avoid outdated libraries affected by known vulnerabilities or relying on poorly maintained code.
*   **Use patch-package:** This tool allows you to fix NPM dependencies instantly.
