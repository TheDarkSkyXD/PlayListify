# Integrated Model - Arc 1: Robustness and Security

This document presents an integrated model for robust and secure dependency management in Electron applications, based on the research findings.

## Core Principles

*   **Defense in Depth:** Employ multiple layers of security to protect against various threats.
*   **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and processes.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the application and its dependencies for security vulnerabilities and suspicious activity.
*   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update the application and its dependencies to address security vulnerabilities and bug fixes.

## Integrated Model Components

1.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Use static binaries for yt-dlp and FFmpeg to simplify installation and reduce dependency conflicts.
    *   Employ a reliable package manager like Yarn for managing other dependencies.
    *   Minimize the number of third-party integrations to reduce the attack surface.
2.  **Security Hardening:**
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent the execution of untrusted code.
    *   Enable context isolation in Electron to protect against XSS attacks.
    *   Address common Electron misconfigurations to prevent security vulnerabilities.
3.  **API Key Management:**
    *   Store API keys securely using node-keytar or Electron's `safeStorage` API.
    *   Implement a server-side proxy to handle API requests and protect the API key.
    *   Rotate API keys periodically to limit the exposure of compromised keys.
4.  **Integrity and Authenticity Verification:**
    *   Provide hashes for release binaries to ensure that what is being downloaded is also what has been built by your pipeline.
    *   Employ code signing to guarantee the source and integrity of the executable files.
    *   Use Dependency Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that files fetched from CDNs or third-party sources haven't been tampered with.
