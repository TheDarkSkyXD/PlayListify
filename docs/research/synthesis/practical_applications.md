# Practical Applications - Arc 1: Robustness and Security

This document outlines the practical applications of the research findings on robust and secure dependency management solutions for yt-dlp and FFmpeg in an Electron application.

*   **Implement secure API key storage:** Use `node-keytar` or Electron's `safeStorage` API to store API keys securely in the operating system's credential store.
*   **Set up a server-side proxy:** Create a server-side proxy to handle API requests and protect the API key from being exposed to the client.
*   **Automate dependency updates:** Use a tool like Dependabot to automate dependency updates and ensure that security patches are applied in a timely manner.
*   **Integrate security testing into the development pipeline:** Use tools like Electronegativity to identify misconfigurations and security anti-patterns in the application.
*   **Establish a robust vendor risk management process:** Assess the security posture of third-party vendors and monitor their adherence to industry standards.
*   **Provide hashes for release binaries:** Generate and distribute hashes for release binaries to allow users to verify their integrity and authenticity.
