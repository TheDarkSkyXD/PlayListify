# Devil's Advocate -- Final Verification Report 2

This report provides a focused verification of the three specific regressions identified in the previous report (`docs/devil/final_verification_report.md`). The purpose is to confirm that the fixes are complete, correct, and do not introduce new contradictions.

## 1. "Smart Quality Fallback" Contradiction

*   **Issue:** The user story promised a "smart quality fallback" feature, while the functional requirements specified a simpler "fail-fast" behavior.
*   **Verification:**
    *   `docs/specifications/user_stories.md` (Story 3.3) has been updated. The acceptance criteria now explicitly state: "The download will follow a fail-fast principle. If a specific video is not available in the quality selected by the user, the download for that single video will fail, and no fallback to a lower quality will be attempted."
    *   This language now perfectly aligns with `docs/specifications/functional_requirements.md` (FR.3.3.4).
*   **Status: [VERIFIED]**

## 2. `availability_status` Mapping Ambiguity

*   **Issue:** The term 'Unlisted' in the user story had no clear mapping to the data model's `availabilityStatus` enum, creating ambiguity.
*   **Verification:**
    *   `docs/specifications/data_models.md` now contains a clear "UI Status Mapping" table that explicitly defines the relationship between the backend enum, the UI color, and the user-facing tooltip.
    *   `docs/specifications/user_stories.md` (Story 5.2) has been updated to directly reference this mapping table. It correctly associates the `PRIVATE` status with a yellow dot and the tooltip "Status: Private or Unlisted", resolving the ambiguity.
*   **Status: [VERIFIED]**

## 3. Health Check Pause Logic Ambiguity

*   **Issue:** The condition for pausing the scheduled health check was vaguely defined as "if a user-initiated task... is active."
*   **Verification:**
    *   Both `docs/specifications/user_stories.md` (Story 5.4) and `docs/specifications/functional_requirements.md` (FR.5.4.2) have been updated with the identical, precise condition: "The scheduler will not initiate a new health check if the background task queue is actively processing tasks (i.e., `queue.size > 0` or `queue.pending > 0`). It will skip the current cycle and attempt to run again at its next scheduled interval."
    *   This provides a clear, implementable, and verifiable rule.
*   **Status: [VERIFIED]**

## Conclusion

**Conclusion: The specification phase is now complete. All identified regressions have been addressed.**
