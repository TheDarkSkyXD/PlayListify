# Pseudocode-- `BackgroundTaskRepository.emitTaskUpdate()`

## 1. Method Definition

- **Name--** `emitTaskUpdate`
- **Parameters--** None
- **Return Type--** `void`
- **Synchronicity--** Synchronous-behaving (may call asynchronous operations but does not return a promise).

## 2. Description

Emits a `task-update` event via the application's event emitter. This event carries the current list of all "QUEUED" or "IN_PROGRESS" tasks, allowing the frontend or other interested clients to receive real-time updates on active background processes. This method is the final step in a throttled update mechanism, ensuring that clients are not overwhelmed with frequent updates.

## 3. Dependencies

-   `this.db`-- An instance of `SQLiteAdapter` used for database communication.
-   `this.appEmitter`-- An instance of an `EventEmitter` used for application-wide event communication.

## 4. Logic

```pseudocode
METHOD emitTaskUpdate()--
    TRY
        // 1. Define the SQL query to select all tasks that are currently active.
        //    Active tasks are those with a status of 'QUEUED' or 'IN_PROGRESS'.
        DEFINE sqlQuery AS STRING = "SELECT * FROM background_tasks WHERE status = 'QUEUED' OR status = 'IN_PROGRESS'"

        // 2. Execute the query to get the list of active tasks.
        //    This is an asynchronous operation, so we wait for it to complete.
        activeTasks = AWAIT this.db.query(sqlQuery)

        // 3. Emit a 'task-update' event with the list of active tasks as the payload.
        //    This notifies all listeners (e.g., the frontend) of the change.
        this.appEmitter.emit("task-update", activeTasks)

    CATCH error
        // 4. If any error occurs during the process (database query or event emission),
        //    log the error for debugging purposes.
        LOG "Error emitting task update-- " + error.message

        // 5. Re-throw the error to allow the calling context to handle the failure.
        //    This ensures that the caller is aware that the update failed.
        THROW error
    END TRY
