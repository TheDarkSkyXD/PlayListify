# Pseudocode: `PlaylistRepository.deletePlaylist(id)`

This document provides the detailed pseudocode for the `deletePlaylist` method.

## Method Definition

```plaintext
CLASS PlaylistRepository
  METHOD deletePlaylist(id: integer) -- Returns PROMISE<void>
```

## Logic

```plaintext
PROMISE(RESOLVE, REJECT)
  // --- Input Validation ---
  IF id IS NOT a positive integer THEN
    REJECT(NEW ArgumentException("Playlist ID must be a positive integer."))
    RETURN
  END IF

  // --- Database Operation ---
  TRY
    // 1. Check if the playlist exists before attempting to delete
    AWAIT existingPlaylist = this.getPlaylist(id)
    IF existingPlaylist IS NULL THEN
      REJECT(NEW NotFoundException(`Playlist with ID ${id} not found.`))
      RETURN
    END IF

    // 2. Define SQL queries for deletion
    //    These should be executed in a transaction to ensure data integrity.
    DEFINE sqlDeleteLinks = "DELETE FROM playlist_videos WHERE playlist_id = ?"
    DEFINE sqlDeletePlaylist = "DELETE FROM playlists WHERE id = ?"

    // 3. Execute deletion from the join table first
    AWAIT this.db.query(sqlDeleteLinks, [id])

    // 4. Execute deletion from the main playlists table
    AWAIT this.db.query(sqlDeletePlaylist, [id])

    // 5. On success, resolve the promise
    RESOLVE()

  CATCH (databaseError)
    // --- Error Handling ---
    LOG "Database error in deletePlaylist-- " + databaseError.message
    REJECT(databaseError)
  END TRY
END PROMISE
```

## Notes

*   **Transactionality**: The two `DELETE` operations (removing associations from `playlist_videos` and the entry from `playlists`) are critically dependent on each other. In a production implementation, they **must** be wrapped in a database transaction. This ensures that if the second `DELETE` fails, the first one is rolled back, preventing orphaned data. The pseudocode shows a sequential execution, but assumes an underlying transaction mechanism would be provided by a method like `db.transaction()`.
*   **Dependencies**: This method relies on `this.getPlaylist(id)` to verify existence before deletion, preventing unnecessary database operations and providing clearer error feedback (`NotFoundException`).
*   **Error Types**:
    *   `ArgumentException`: Thrown for invalid input (`id`).
    *   `NotFoundException`: Thrown if the playlist to be deleted does not exist.
    *   Generic `Error`: Any other error, typically from the database adapter, is caught and re-thrown.
