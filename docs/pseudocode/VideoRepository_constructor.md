# Pseudocode for VideoRepository.constructor

## Description
Initializes a new instance of the VideoRepository class, setting up the necessary database connection adapter.

## Class
`VideoRepository`

## Constructor
`CONSTRUCTOR(dbAdapter)`

### Parameters
-   `dbAdapter` (`SQLiteAdapter`)-- The database adapter instance for interacting with the database.

### Pre-conditions
-   The application must have a valid and initialized `SQLiteAdapter` instance to pass to this constructor.

### Post-conditions
-   A new `VideoRepository` instance is created.
-   The `this.db` property of the instance is set to the provided `dbAdapter`.
-   An `ArgumentException` is thrown if the `dbAdapter` is null or undefined.

### Logic
1.  `BEGIN CONSTRUCTOR(dbAdapter)`
2.      `IF dbAdapter IS NULL OR UNDEFINED THEN`
3.          `THROW New ArgumentException("SQLiteAdapter instance cannot be null.")`
4.      `END IF`
5.
6.      `SET this.db TO dbAdapter`
7.  `END CONSTRUCTOR`

### Error Handling
-   **Error:** `dbAdapter` is not provided.
    -   **Action:** The constructor will `THROW` an `ArgumentException`. This is a critical error, as the repository cannot function without a database connection. The calling code is responsible for catching this exception and handling it appropriately, perhaps by logging the error and terminating the process or displaying an error message to the user.
