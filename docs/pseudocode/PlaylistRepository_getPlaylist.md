# Pseudocode-- PlaylistRepository.getPlaylist

This document outlines the pseudocode for the `getPlaylist` method in the `PlaylistRepository` class.

## Method-- getPlaylist

**Signature--** `getPlaylist(id: integer): Promise<Playlist>`

**Description--** Retrieves a single playlist from the database by its unique ID.

---

### **1. Logic**

The method's execution is wrapped in a `PROMISE` to handle asynchronous database operations.

```plaintext
METHOD getPlaylist(id)
  RETURN NEW PROMISE((RESOLVE, REJECT) => {

    // --- 1.1. Input Validation ---
    IF id is not of type integer OR id IS NULL OR id <= 0 THEN
      CONSTANT validationError = NEW ArgumentException("Playlist ID must be a positive integer.")
      LOG "Validation failed-- " + validationError.message
      REJECT(validationError)
      RETURN
    END IF

    // --- 1.2. Database Query ---
    CONSTANT SQL_SELECT_PLAYLIST = "SELECT id, title, description, type, createdAt, updatedAt, lastHealthCheck FROM playlists WHERE id = ?;"

    // --- 1.3. Execute Query ---
    TRY
      // AWAIT the result from the database adapter's query method
      CONSTANT result = AWAIT this.db.query(SQL_SELECT_PLAYLIST, [id])

      // --- 1.4. Process Result ---
      IF result AND result.length > 0 THEN
        // Found the playlist, resolve with the first row
        CONSTANT playlistObject = result[0]
        RESOLVE(playlistObject)
      ELSE
        // No playlist found with the given ID
        RESOLVE(NULL)
      END IF

    CATCH (databaseError)
      // --- 1.5. Error Handling ---
      LOG "Failed to retrieve playlist from database. Error-- " + databaseError.message
      REJECT(databaseError)
    END TRY
  })
END METHOD
```

### **2. Components**

-   **PROMISE Block--** Manages the asynchronous nature of the database call.
-   **Input Validation--** A guard clause at the beginning of the method checks if the `id` is a valid positive integer. If not, the promise is immediately rejected.
-   **SQL Definition--** A constant holds the SQL query string for clarity and security (using a parameterized query).
-   **TRY...CATCH Block--** Encapsulates the database operation to gracefully handle any potential errors during the query execution.
-   **`this.db.query()`--** The call to the database adapter, which is expected to return a promise that resolves with an array of results.
-   **Result Handling--**
    -   If the `result` array contains one or more items, the promise is resolved with the first item, which represents the `Playlist` object.
    -   If the `result` array is empty, it means no playlist was found, and the promise is resolved with `NULL`.
-   **Error Handling--** If the `CATCH` block is triggered, the error is logged for debugging purposes, and the promise is rejected with the captured `databaseError`.
