# Pseudocode: PlaylistManager.createPlaylist

## Method: `createPlaylist(title: string, description: string, type: string): Promise<Playlist>`

This method creates a new playlist by delegating the operation to the `playlistRepository`. It encapsulates the creation logic within a promise, ensuring asynchronous handling of the database interaction and robust error propagation.

---

### **Inputs:**
-   `title` (string)-- The desired title for the new playlist.
-   `description` (string)-- A description for the new playlist.
-   `type` (string)-- The type of the playlist (e.g., "YOUTUBE", "CUSTOM").

### **Outputs:**
-   **Success:** `Promise<Playlist>` - A promise that resolves with the newly created `Playlist` object.
-   **Failure:** `Promise<Error>` - A promise that rejects with an error object if the creation fails at the repository level.

---

### **Procedure:**

```plaintext
METHOD createPlaylist(title, description, type)
  RETURN NEW PROMISE((RESOLVE, REJECT) => {
    
    // Use a TRY...CATCH block to handle potential errors from the repository layer.
    TRY
      // Delegate the playlist creation to the repository layer.
      // This call is asynchronous and must be awaited.
      LOG "PlaylistManager: Delegating playlist creation to repository."
      newPlaylist = AWAIT this.playlistRepository.createPlaylist(title, description, type)
      
      // If the repository call is successful, resolve the promise with the new playlist.
      LOG "PlaylistManager: Playlist created successfully. Resolving promise."
      RESOLVE(newPlaylist)
      
    CATCH (error)
      // If an error occurs during the repository operation, log it for debugging.
      LOG "PlaylistManager: Error creating playlist. Propagating error."
      LOG "Error: " + error.message
      
      // Reject the promise, passing the error to the caller for handling.
      REJECT(error)
    END TRY
    
  }) // END PROMISE
END METHOD
```

### **Error Handling:**
-   The method relies on the `playlistRepository` to perform any necessary validation or handle database-specific errors.
-   Any exception thrown by `this.playlistRepository.createPlaylist` is caught and propagated by rejecting the promise. This allows the calling layer (e.g., a service or controller) to implement its own error handling logic, such as displaying a message to the user.
