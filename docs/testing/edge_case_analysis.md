# SQLiteAdapter Edge Case Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the edge cases for the `SQLiteAdapter` class.

## Constructor Edge Cases

### EC.12: Database Path with Trailing Spaces

*   Description: The `dbPath` parameter contains trailing spaces.
*   Potential Impact: The constructor might fail to connect to the database if the trailing spaces are not handled correctly.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`

### EC.13: Schema Path with Relative Navigation

*   Description: The `schemaPath` parameter contains relative navigation (e.g., `../schema/database_schema.sql`).
*   Potential Impact: The constructor might fail to locate the schema file if the relative path is not resolved correctly.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`

### EC.14: Database Connection with Corrupted Database File

*   Description: The database file is corrupted.
*   Potential Impact: The constructor might fail to connect to the database or might lead to unexpected behavior.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`

### EC.15: Schema Application with Recursive Views

*   Description: The schema contains recursive views.
*   Potential Impact: The schema application might fail if SQLite does not support recursive views or if there are errors in the view definition.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`

## Query Method Edge Cases

### EC.16: Query with Very Large Number of Parameters

*   Description: The `query` method is called with a very large number of parameters.
*   Potential Impact: The query execution might fail if SQLite has a limit on the number of parameters.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`

### EC.17: Query with Parameters Containing Binary Data

*   Description: The `query` method is called with parameters containing binary data.
*   Potential Impact: The query execution might fail if the binary data is not handled correctly.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`

### EC.18: Query Timeout During Parameter Binding

*   Description: The query timeout expires during the parameter binding process.
*   Potential Impact: The query might be aborted prematurely, leading to incomplete results.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`

### EC.19: Deadlock with Multiple Concurrent Queries

*   Description: Multiple concurrent queries are executed, resulting in a deadlock.
*   Potential Impact: The query execution might be blocked indefinitely, leading to application unresponsiveness.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`

### EC.20: Database Connection Loss During Transaction Commit

*   Description: The database connection is lost during the transaction commit process.
*   Potential Impact: The transaction might be rolled back, leading to data loss.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`

### EC.21: Query with SQL Triggers that cause infinite loops

*   Description: The SQL contains triggers that cause infinite loops when the query is executed.
*   Potential Impact: The query might run indefinitely, consuming resources and blocking other operations.
*   Test Code: See `tests/edge_cases/sqlite_adapter_edge_cases.test.ts`
