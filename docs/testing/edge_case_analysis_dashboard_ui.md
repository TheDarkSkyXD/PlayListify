# Edge Case Analysis: Dashboard UI (User Story 1.2)

This document outlines potential edge cases for the Dashboard UI, focusing on the "Recent Playlists" and "Continue Watching" sections. The goal is to ensure the UI remains stable, predictable, and user-friendly under non-ideal conditions.

### 1. Partial Data States

**Description:** This category covers scenarios where one section of the dashboard has data to display while the other does not.

| # | Condition | Expected UI Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | "Recent Playlists" has data, but "Continue Watching" is empty. | The "Recent Playlists" section should render its list of playlists correctly. The "Continue Watching" section must display its specific empty-state message (e.g., "Nothing to continue watching."). |
| 1.2 | "Continue Watching" has data, but "Recent Playlists" is empty. | The "Continue Watching" section should render its content correctly. The "Recent Playlists" section must display its empty-state message (e.g., "No recent playlists to show."). |

### 2. Asynchronous Loading and Data Fetching

**Description:** This category addresses the UI's behavior while data is being fetched from a remote source, which may vary in response time.

| # | Condition | Expected UI Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Data for both sections is being fetched. | Both the "Recent Playlists" and "Continue Watching" sections should independently display a loading state, such as a skeleton loader or a spinner. The rest of the UI must remain responsive. |
| 2.2 | "Recent Playlists" data arrives, but "Continue Watching" is still loading. | The "Recent Playlists" section should render its data, replacing its loading indicator. The "Continue Watching" section should continue to display its loading state until its data arrives. |
| 2.3 | "Continue Watching" data arrives, but "Recent Playlists" is still loading. | The "Continue Watching" section should render its data, replacing its loading indicator. The "Recent Playlists" section should continue to display its loading state until its data arrives. |

### 3. Component Rendering Failures

**Description:** This category covers scenarios where a critical JavaScript error prevents a component from rendering.

| # | Condition | Expected UI Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | An error occurs while rendering the "Recent Playlists" section. | The application must not crash. An error boundary should catch the exception and render a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Could not load this section.") in place of the "Recent Playlists" component. The "Continue Watching" section should render normally. |
| 3.2 | An error occurs while rendering the "Continue Watching" section. | The application must not crash. An error boundary should catch the exception and display a user-friendly error message in place of the "Continue Watching" component. The "Recent Playlists" section should render normally. |

### 4. Content Overflow

**Description:** This category addresses how the UI handles unexpectedly long content strings that could break the layout.

| # | Condition | Expected UI Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | A playlist title is extremely long (e.g., 200+ characters). | The playlist title text should be gracefully truncated to fit within its container. The full title should be accessible, for example, via a tooltip on hover. The layout of the playlist card and surrounding elements must not be broken. |
