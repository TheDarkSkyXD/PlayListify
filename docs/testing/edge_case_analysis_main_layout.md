# Edge Case Analysis for User Story 1.1: Main Application Layout

## Introduction

This document outlines the edge case analysis for the main application layout as defined in User Story 1.1. The purpose is to identify and define expected behaviors for scenarios that go beyond the standard acceptance criteria, ensuring the application's UI is robust, resilient, and provides a consistent user experience under various conditions.

## Edge Case Analysis

### 1. Responsive Layout & Viewport Sizes

*   **Scenario:** The application window is resized to various common and extreme dimensions. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Standard Desktop (e.g., 1920x1080)
    *   Large Monitor (e.g., 2560x1440)
    *   Tablet Portrait (e.g., 768x1024)
    *   Tablet Landscape (e.g., 1024x768)
    *   Mobile Portrait (e.g., 375x667)
    *   Mobile Landscape (e.g., 667x375)
    *   Extremely narrow width (e.g., 320px)
    *   Extremely short height (e.g., 400px)

*   **Expected Behavior:**
    *   The layout must adapt gracefully to all viewport sizes without breaking.
    *   The `#sidebar`, `#top-nav`, and `#main-content` components should remain visible and accessible.
    *   No visual glitches, such as element overlapping, content overflow, or distorted proportions, should occur.
    *   On smaller screens (mobile/tablet), navigation elements might transform (e.g., sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu), but they must remain functional.
    *   The main content area should resize correctly, and any content within it should reflow appropriately.

### 2. Component Loading & Rendering

*   **Scenario:** Simulate a slow network or delayed rendering where one or more of the core layout components (`#sidebar`, `#top-nav`, `#main-content`) fails to render immediately or is significantly delayed. This can also include the failure of CSS or JavaScript files required for layout styling and functionality.

*   **Expected Behavior:**
    *   The application must not crash or become unresponsive.
    *   A loading state or skeleton screen should be displayed as a placeholder for the delayed components to indicate that content is being loaded. This provides better user feedback than a blank or partially rendered page.
    *   If a component fails to load entirely after a timeout, a user-friendly error message or a "retry" option should be presented within the affected area.
    *   Once a delayed component successfully loads, it must appear in its correct position within the layout without requiring a full page refresh.

### 3. Empty State

*   **Scenario:** The application loads successfully, but the main content area is intentionally empty. This is the default state before any specific view, like a playlist or settings page, is loaded into `#main-content`.

*   **Expected Behavior:**
    *   The `#main-content` container must exist in the DOM and occupy its designated space in the application grid.
    *   The overall layout structure (sidebar and top navigation) must remain stable and correctly positioned.
    *   The empty `#main-content` area should not cause any layout shifts or collapses in the surrounding components. It should simply be an empty container, perhaps with a background color, ready to receive content.
