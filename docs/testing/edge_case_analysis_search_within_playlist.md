# Edge Case Analysis: User Story 1.5 - Search within Playlist

**Objective:** This document outlines the systematic identification and analysis of edge cases, boundary conditions, and potential failure modes for the "Search within Playlist" feature (User Story 1.5). The goal is to inform the creation of a comprehensive and resilient test suite.

**User Story 1.5:** As a user, I want to search for a specific video by title within a selected playlist so that I can find content quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   **AC1:** The playlist detail view contains a text input field for search.
*   **AC2:** Typing a query filters the video list client-side based on a case-insensitive match of the video title.
*   **AC3:** The number of visible `.video-list-item` elements updates to match the search results.
*   **AC4:** Clearing the search query restores the full video list.
*   **AC5:** Searching for a term with no matches displays a "No results found" message.

## 1. Input-Based Edge Cases

These cases focus on the variety and format of user-provided search queries.

| Scenario | Description | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Empty Query** | User enters an empty string (`""`) into the search box. | The filter is not applied. The full video list is displayed, identical to the state before any search. |
| **Whitespace Query** | User enters a string containing only whitespace characters (e.g., `" "`, `"   "`). | The input should be trimmed, treating it as an empty query. The full video list is displayed. |
| **Special Characters** | User searches with a query containing special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`). | The search should literally match the characters in video titles. The application must not crash or throw an error. If no titles match, the "No results found" message appears. |
| **Unicode & Emojis** | User searches with a query containing Unicode (e.g., `Ã©`, `Ã¼`) or emojis (e.g., `ðŸ˜‚`). | The search must correctly handle and match these characters within video titles without encoding issues. |
| **Very Long Query** | User enters an extremely long string (e.g., >500 characters). | The UI must handle the long string gracefully (e.g., text-overflow). The search function should not crash or lag significantly and should perform the match correctly. |
| **Case Mismatch** | A video is titled "Epic Rock Anthem". User searches for `epic`, `ROCK`, and `AnThEm`. | The search must be case-insensitive. All three queries should successfully match and display the video. |

## 2. Data-Based Edge Cases

These cases focus on the state and content of the playlist data being searched.

| Scenario | Description | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Empty Playlist** | User attempts to search within a playlist containing zero videos. | The search input should ideally be disabled. If enabled, searching should have no effect, and the existing "Playlist is empty" message should persist without being replaced by a "No results found" message. |
| **All Titles Identical** | A playlist contains multiple videos all titled "Live Concert". | A search for "Live Concert" or "Concert" should return all items. A search for "Interview" should return zero items and the "No results found" message. |
| **Single-Video Playlist**| A playlist contains only one video. | Search should function correctly, showing the video if it matches the query and the "No results found" message if it doesn't. |
| **Titles with Special Chars**| A video title is `My "Top 10" Moments!`. User searches for `"Top 10"`. | The search must correctly match the substring, including the special characters. |
| **Titles with Whitespace**| A video title has leading/trailing spaces, e.g., `"  Cool Song  "`. User searches `Cool Song`. | The search should ideally work by trimming whitespace from either the title, the query, or both before comparison. The match should be successful. |
| **Extremely Long Titles**| A video title is over 200 characters long. | The title should be handled gracefully in the UI (e.g., truncation). The search functionality must still be able to match substrings within the full, non-truncated title. |

## 3. UI/Interaction Edge Cases

These cases focus on the timing and method of user interaction with the search UI.

| Scenario | Description | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rapid Input/Deletion** | User types and deletes characters in the search box very quickly. | The UI must not freeze or enter a race condition. The filtering logic should be debounced or throttled to ensure only the final input is processed, leading to a stable and correct final list. |
| **Pasting Content** | User pastes a string into the search box using Ctrl+V or right-click -> paste. | The search should trigger and filter the list correctly, as if the text were typed manually. |
| **Clearing During Filter** | User clears the input field while a (potentially slow) filter operation is in progress. | Any pending filter operation should be cancelled. The UI must immediately and correctly revert to showing the full, unfiltered list. |
| **Losing Focus (Blur)** | User types a query and then clicks or tabs away from the search input. | The search query and the filtered results must persist. The UI state should not change simply because the input lost focus. |
| **Browser Autofill** | The browser autofills a previous query into the search box. | The search should trigger based on the autofilled value and display the correct results. |

## 4. Performance Edge Cases

These cases focus on the performance of the feature under heavy load.

| Scenario | Description | Expected Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Large Playlist** | User performs a search on a playlist with 1,000+ videos. | The client-side filtering must remain responsive, with no noticeable lag or UI freezing as the user types. The time from the last keystroke to the UI update should be minimal. |
| **Low-Powered Device** | User performs a search on a low-end mobile device or a computer with limited resources. | The feature must remain usable and should not crash the browser tab or application. Performance might be degraded, but it should not lead to a complete failure. |
