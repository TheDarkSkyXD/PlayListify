# Edge Case Analysis for User Story 1.4: View Playlist Details

This document outlines the edge cases for viewing the details of a playlist. The goal is to ensure the application is robust, handles unexpected data gracefully, and provides a clear user experience under various failure conditions.

## 1. Data-Related Edge Cases

These cases test the system's response to unusual or unexpected data states.

| Case ID | Edge Case Description | Expected Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DE-01** | **Empty Playlist:** User selects a playlist that contains zero videos. | The UI should display the playlist title and a video count of "0". An informative message like "This playlist has no videos" should be shown in the video list area. The application should not crash. |
| **DE-02** | **Non-Existent Playlist:** User navigates to a URL with a playlist ID that does not exist in the database. | The application should display a clear "Playlist not found" error page or message. It should not show a loading spinner indefinitely or crash. |
| **DE-03** | **Long Metadata:** A video within the playlist has an exceptionally long title or channel name. | The UI must handle the overflow gracefully. Text should be truncated with an ellipsis (...), and the full text could optionally be shown in a tooltip on hover. The overall card layout should not break or distort. |
| **DE-04** | **Missing Metadata:** A video is missing common properties, such as its thumbnail URL or duration. | The UI should display a default placeholder thumbnail. If duration is missing, that element should be gracefully hidden or show a default state (e.g., "--:--"). The application must not crash due to `null` or `undefined` properties. |
| **DE-05** | **Special Characters:** Playlist or video titles contain special characters (e.g., emojis, non-ASCII characters, HTML tags). | The characters should be rendered correctly without being misinterpreted as HTML or causing encoding issues. XSS vulnerabilities should be prevented by sanitizing the data. |

## 2. Failure-Related Edge Cases

These cases test the system's resilience when external dependencies or internal processes fail.

| Case ID | Edge Case Description | Expected Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FE-01** | **Video Fetch Failure:** The network request to fetch the list of videos for a valid playlist fails (e.g., HTTP 500 Internal Server Error). | The skeleton loader should be removed, and a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Failed to load videos. Please try again.") should be displayed. The playlist title and other static details should still be visible. A retry mechanism could be offered. |
| **FE-02** | **Playlist Metadata Fetch Failure:** The initial database query to fetch the playlist's own metadata (title, count) fails. | The application should display a generic but clear error view, indicating that the content could not be loaded. It should not get stuck on a loading screen. |
| **FE-03** | **Network Disconnection:** The user loses internet connectivity while attempting to view a playlist. | The browser's default network error handling is acceptable, but a custom, more user-friendly offline message within the application is preferred. The application should not enter an inconsistent state. |

## 3. UI/Interaction Edge Cases

These cases test the user interface's behavior under rapid or unusual user interactions.

| Case ID | Edge Case Description | Expected Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UI-01** | **Rapid Navigation:** User quickly clicks on multiple different playlists from the sidebar. | The application should correctly cancel any pending requests from previously selected playlists and only render the data for the most recently selected one. There should be no race conditions where data from an old request overwrites the new view. |
| **UI-02** | **Window Resizing:** The user resizes the browser window while the playlist details are loading (skeleton view) or are fully rendered. | The layout should remain responsive and adapt correctly to the new viewport size without breaking, overlapping elements, or visual glitches. |
