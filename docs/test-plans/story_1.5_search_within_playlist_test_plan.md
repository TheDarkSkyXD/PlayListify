# Test Plan-- User Story 1.5-- Search Within a Playlist

This document outlines the granular test plan for User Story 1.5, which focuses on the client-side search functionality within a selected playlist.

## 1. Test Scope

This test plan specifically targets the AI-verifiable end results defined in the acceptance criteria for **User Story 1.5**. The goal is to ensure that a user can effectively search for videos by title within a playlist, and that the UI behaves predictably and correctly in all scenarios.

## 2. Testing Principles

We will adhere to the **London School of Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Collaborators, such as IPC handlers that provide video data, will be mocked. This allows us to test the search component in isolation, focusing on its direct outputs-- specifically, the changes in the DOM (the rendered list of videos) in response to user input. All tests will verify observable outcomes from a user's perspective.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Test Cases

The following test cases are designed to validate each acceptance criterion for User Story 1.5.

---

### **Test Case ID-- TC_1.5.1**

*   **Acceptance Criterion**-- AC1-- The playlist detail view contains a text input field for search.
*   **Test Objective**-- To verify that the search input field is rendered and visible when the user navigates to the playlist detail view.
*   **Prerequisites/Setup**-- The application is in a state where a playlist has been selected and the playlist detail view is the active view.
*   **Test Steps**--
    1.  Programmatically navigate to the playlist detail view for a known playlist.
    2.  Attempt to locate the search input element using a unique selector, such as `#playlist-search-input`.
*   **Expected Result**-- The DOM query successfully finds the search input element, and an assertion confirms that the element is visible to the user.
*   **Mocking Strategy**-- The application's navigation state will be controlled directly. Any IPC calls to fetch playlist details will be intercepted and responded to with mock data to ensure the view renders consistently without depending on a real backend or file system.

### **Test Case ID-- TC_1.5.2**

*   **Acceptance Criterion**--
    *   AC2-- Typing a query filters the video list client-side based on a case-insensitive match of the video title.
    *   AC3-- The number of visible `.video-list-item` elements updates to match the search results, verifiable via DOM assertion.
*   **Test Objective**-- To verify that the video list filters correctly based on a case-insensitive search query and that the DOM updates to display only the matching items.
*   **Prerequisites/Setup**-- The playlist detail view is loaded with a mocked, predictable list of 10 videos. The video titles are known (e.g., "Test Video 1", "Sample Video 2", "Another Test Video"). The search input field is empty.
*   **Test Steps**--
    1.  Verify that 10 instances of `.video-list-item` are initially visible.
    2.  Locate the search input (`#playlist-search-input`) and type the query "test video".
    3.  Count the number of visible `.video-list-item` elements.
    4.  For each visible item, verify that its title contains the text "Test Video".
*   **Expected Result**-- After typing the query, exactly 2 `.video-list-item` elements are visible. The visible items are confirmed to be "Test Video 1" and "Another Test Video".
*   **Mocking Strategy**-- The IPC handler responsible for fetching video data for a playlist will be mocked to return a static, known array of video objects. This ensures the test is not affected by changes in the actual data and provides a stable dataset for asserting filter logic.

### **Test Case ID-- TC_1.5.3**

*   **Acceptance Criterion**-- AC4-- Clearing the search query restores the full video list.
*   **Test Objective**-- To verify that the video list returns to its complete, unfiltered state after a search query is cleared.
*   **Prerequisites/Setup**-- The playlist detail view is loaded with the same mocked list of 10 videos. A search query has been entered, and the list is currently filtered.
*   **Test Steps**--
    1.  First, perform the steps from TC_1.5.2 to ensure the list is in a filtered state (2 items visible).
    2.  Locate the search input (`#playlist-search-input`).
    3.  Programmatically clear the value of the input field.
    4.  Count the number of visible `.video-list-item` elements.
*   **Expected Result**-- After clearing the input, the number of visible `.video-list-item` elements returns to the original count of 10.
*   **Mocking Strategy**-- Utilizes the same mock IPC handler as TC_1.5.2 to provide the consistent list of 10 videos.

---

### **Test Case ID-- TC_1.5.4**

*   **Acceptance Criterion**-- AC5-- Searching for a term with no matches displays a "No results found" message.
*   **Test Objective**-- To verify that a user-friendly message is displayed when a search query yields no matching videos.
*   **Prerequisites/Setup**-- The playlist detail view is loaded with the mocked list of 10 videos. The search input is empty.
*   **Test Steps**--
    1.  Locate the search input (`#playlist-search-input`).
    2.  Type a query that does not match any video titles, such as "nonexistent-xyz-query".
    3.  Check for the visibility of the "No results found" message container (e.g., `#no-results-message`).
    4.  Verify that the number of visible `.video-list-item` elements is 0.
*   **Expected Result**-- The `#no-results-message` element is visible and contains the text "No results found". The count of visible `.video-list-item` elements is 0.
*   **Mocking Strategy**-- Utilizes the same mock IPC handler as TC_1.5.2.

## 4. Broader Testing Strategies

### Regression Testing Strategy

All test cases (TC_1.5.1 through TC_1.5.4) will be integrated into the automated regression test suite. These tests will execute on every commit to the main development branch. This forms a recursive regression strategy-- any change to related components (e.g., the playlist view, shared UI components) will trigger this test suite, ensuring that existing search functionality remains intact.

### Edge Case Testing Strategy

The following edge cases will be tested to ensure robustness--
*   **Input with Special Characters**-- Search for titles containing `&`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `'`.
*   **Whitespace**-- Search with leading, trailing, and multiple internal spaces.
*   **Substring Ambiguity**-- Search for a term that is a substring of multiple titles (e.g., "Video") to ensure all are returned.
*   **Performance**-- Test with a very large (e.g., 1,000+) list of mock videos to check for UI responsiveness during filtering.
*   **Rapid Input**-- Simulate rapid typing, deleting, and pasting in the search field to check for race conditions or performance lags in the filtering logic.

### Chaos Testing Strategy

To ensure resilience, chaos testing will involve--
*   **UI Latency Injection**-- Introduce artificial delays into the rendering process to simulate a slow or stressed system, and verify that the search and filter operations still complete correctly.
*   **Concurrent Operations**-- Initiate a search while a simulated background task (like a video download) is active to ensure the UI remains responsive and does not freeze.
*   **Data Corruption**-- Momentarily mock the video data source to return an empty or malformed array while a search is active to see if the UI handles the error gracefully (e.g., shows an error message, doesn't crash).
