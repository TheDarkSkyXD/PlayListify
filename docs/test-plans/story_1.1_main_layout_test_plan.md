# Test Plan: User Story 1.1 - Main Application Layout

## Objective
This document outlines the test plan for **User Story 1.1**, which requires the main application to launch with a persistent sidebar and top navigation bar, establishing the basic visual structure of the application for the user.

## Testing Strategy
Testing will be conducted using the Playwright framework. The strategy combines End-to-End (E2E) functional testing to verify the presence and visibility of core layout components and visual regression testing to ensure the application's visual integrity is maintained against a baseline.

## Test Cases

### Acceptance Criterion 1: The application launches and displays a single, primary window.

*   **Test Case 1.1.1: Verify Application Window Launch**
    *   **Description:** Ensures that the application starts and a single main window is rendered.
    *   **Tool:** Playwright
    *   **Action:** Launch the application.
    *   **Expected Result (AI Verifiable):** Assert that the count of visible `BrowserWindow` instances is exactly 1.

### Acceptance Criterion 2: The primary layout components are rendered in their correct positions.

*   **Test Case 1.1.2: Verify Sidebar Visibility**
    *   **Description:** Confirms that the sidebar component is present in the DOM and is visible to the user.
    *   **Tool:** Playwright
    *   **Selector:** `#sidebar`
    *   **Action:** Load the main application page.
    *   **Expected Result (AI Verifiable):** Assert that the element with the ID `#sidebar` exists and is visible.

*   **Test Case 1.1.3: Verify Top Navigation Bar Visibility**
    *   **Description:** Confirms that the top navigation bar component is present in the DOM and is visible to the user.
    *   **Tool:** Playwright
    *   **Selector:** `#top-nav`
    *   **Action:** Load the main application page.
    *   **Expected Result (AI Verifiable):** Assert that the element with the ID `#top-nav` exists and is visible.

*   **Test Case 1.1.4: Verify Main Content Area Visibility**
    *   **Description:** Confirms that the main content area is present in the DOM and is visible to the user.
    *   **Tool:** Playwright
    *   **Selector:** `#main-content`
    *   **Action:** Load the main application page.
    *   **Expected Result (AI Verifiable):** Assert that the element with the ID `#main-content` exists and is visible.

### Acceptance Criterion 3: A visual regression snapshot of the initial application layout matches the baseline image.

*   **Test Case 1.1.5: Baseline Visual Snapshot**
    *   **Description:** Captures a screenshot of the entire application page on initial load and compares it to a pre-approved baseline image to detect any unintended visual changes.
    *   **Tool:** Playwright
    *   **Action:** Load the main application page and take a full-page screenshot.
    *   **Expected Result (AI Verifiable):** Assert that the captured screenshot matches the baseline image `main-layout.png` within an acceptable threshold.
