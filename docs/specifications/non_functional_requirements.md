    *   **Rationale:** To protect sensitive data from unauthorized access in case of a data breach.
    *   Measurement:** Sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption, and code review confirms proper encryption implementation.
*   **NFR.S.5:** Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Rationale:** To proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.
    *   **Measurement:** Conduct annual security audits and penetration testing by qualified security professionals.
*   **NFR.S.6:** Use Electronegativity to identify misconfigurations and security anti-patterns.
    *   **Rationale:** To ensure secure Electron configuration.
    *   **Measurement:** Run Electronegativity on each build and address any identified issues.

## Usability

*   **NFR.U.1:** The application shall have a clear and intuitive user interface.
    *   **Rationale:** To make the application easy to use and navigate.
    *   **Measurement:** A System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 70 or higher.
*   **NFR.U.2:** The application shall provide helpful error messages to guide users when they encounter problems.
    *   **Rationale:** To assist users in resolving issues and completing their tasks.
    *   **Measurement:** 80% of users rate error messages as helpful in a post-task survey.
*   **NFR.U.3:** The application shall be accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG guidelines.
    *   **Rationale:** To ensure that the application is usable by everyone.
    *   **Measurement:** Accessibility audits using tools like WAVE.

## Reliability

*   **NFR.R.1:** The application shall be available 99% of the time.
    *   **Rationale:** To ensure that users can access the application when they need it.
    *   **Measurement:** Uptime monitoring.
*   **NFR.R.2:** The application shall be able to recover from failures gracefully.
    *   **Rationale:** To minimize the impact of errors on the user experience.
    *   **Measurement:** Mean time to recovery (MTTR) from failures is less than 30 minutes, and the error rate is less than 0.1%.
*   **NFR.R.3:** The application shall be able to handle a large number of concurrent users without performance degradation.
    *   **Rationale:** To ensure that the application can scale to meet the needs of a growing user base.
    *   **Measurement:** Load testing and stress testing.

## Maintainability

*   **NFR.M.1:** The codebase shall be well-documented and easy to understand.
    *   **Rationale:** To facilitate maintenance and future development.
    *   **Measurement:** Code Maintainability Index (CMI) score of 70 or higher, as measured by static analysis tools.
*   **NFR.M.2:** The application shall be designed in a modular way, with clear separation of concerns.
    *   **Rationale:** To make it easier to modify and extend the application.
    *   **Measurement:** Coupling Between Objects (CBO) metric is below 20, as measured by static analysis tools.
*   **NFR.M.3:** The application shall use consistent coding standards and conventions.
    *   **Rationale:** To improve code readability and maintainability.
    *   **Measurement:** Linting and code style checks.

## Scalability
