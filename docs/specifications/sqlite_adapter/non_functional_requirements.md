# SQLiteAdapter Non-Functional Requirements

This document details the non-functional requirements for the `SQLiteAdapter` class. Refer to [`docs/specifications/sqlite_adapter/functional_requirements.md`](docs/specifications/sqlite_adapter/functional_requirements.md) for functional requirements.

## Constructor

### NFR.1: Performance
**Description:** The constructor must establish a database connection and apply the schema within an acceptable time frame.
**Success Criteria:**
*   NFR.1.1: The database connection is established within 2 seconds on average.
*   NFR.1.2: The schema is applied within 5 seconds on average.

### NFR.2: Reliability
**Description:** The constructor must reliably establish a database connection, even in the face of transient errors.
**Success Criteria:**
*   NFR.2.1: The constructor retries the database connection up to `maxRetries` times with exponential backoff.
*   NFR.2.2: The database connection check timer ensures that the connection is re-established if it is lost.

### NFR.3: Security
**Description:** The constructor must securely apply the database schema (see FR.4 in [`docs/specifications/sqlite_adapter/functional_requirements.md`](docs/specifications/sqlite_adapter/functional_requirements.md)).
**Success Criteria:**
*   NFR.3.1: The schema file is read with appropriate file system permissions.
*   NFR.3.2: The database file is secured using AES-256 encryption. Encryption is enabled by default.
*   NFR.3.3: The encryption key is managed using a secure key management system (e.g., a hardware security module or a key vault). The specific key management system used should be documented.
*   NFR.3.4: The encryption key is not stored in the application code or configuration files.
## Query Method

### NFR.4: Performance
**Description:** The `query` method must execute queries efficiently and return results within an acceptable time frame.
**Success Criteria:**
*   NFR.4.1: Simple queries (e.g., SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 10) are executed within 500ms on average.
*   NFR.4.2: Complex queries (e.g., JOIN operations, aggregations) are executed within 5 seconds on average.

### NFR.5: Reliability
**Description:** The `query` method must reliably execute queries, even in the face of transient errors.
**Success Criteria:**
*   NFR.5.1: The `query` method retries queries that fail due to deadlock errors.
*   NFR.5.2: The `query` method implements a timeout mechanism to prevent long-running queries from blocking the application.

### NFR.6: Security
**Description:** The `query` method must prevent SQL injection attacks (see FR.7 in [`docs/specifications/sqlite_adapter/functional_requirements.md`](docs/specifications/sqlite_adapter/functional_requirements.md)).
**Success Criteria:**
*   NFR.6.1: The `query` method uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
*   NFR.6.2: Input parameters are properly escaped and validated.

### NFR.7: Maintainability
**Description:** The code should be well-structured and easy to understand and maintain.
**Success Criteria:**
*   NFR.7.1: Code has a cyclomatic complexity of less than 10 per module.
*   NFR.7.2: Code has unit tests covering at least 80% of the code paths.
*   NFR.7.3: Code is divided into well-defined modules, each with a clear purpose and interface. Each module should have less than 200 lines of code.
