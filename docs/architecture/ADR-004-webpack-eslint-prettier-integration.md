# ADR-004: Integration of Webpack, ESLint, and Prettier for Build Automation, Code Linting, and Formatting

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Context:**
    *   The project is an Electron application built with TypeScript.
    *   The current development workflow lacks an automated build process, consistent code style enforcement, and static analysis for potential errors.
    *   This leads to potential inconsistencies, manual overhead, and a higher risk of bugs.
*   **Decision:**
    *   **Webpack:** Will be adopted as the module bundler. It will transpile TypeScript to JavaScript, bundle application code, and manage assets. A `webpack.config.js` file will be created to manage development and production builds.
    *   **ESLint:** Will be used for static analysis to find and fix problems in the TypeScript code. A `.eslintrc.json` configuration file will define the linting rules, extending from recommended presets like `eslint:recommended` and `@typescript-eslint/recommended`.
    *   **Prettier:** Will be used to enforce a consistent code style across the entire codebase. A `.prettierrc` file will define the formatting rules. It will be integrated with ESLint using `eslint-plugin-prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier` to avoid rule conflicts.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   **Positive:**
        *   Automated and optimized builds for production.
        *   Improved code quality and consistency.
        *   Early detection of bugs and potential issues.
        *   Streamlined developer workflow.
    *   **Negative:**
        *   Increased initial setup complexity.
        *   Additional `npm` dependencies to manage.
        *   A learning curve for team members unfamiliar with these tools.
*   **Implementation Plan:**
    *   **NPM Dependencies (add to `package.json` `devDependencies`):**
        *   `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `webpack-dev-server`, `ts-loader`, `typescript`, `html-webpack-plugin`
        *   `eslint`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `eslint-plugin-prettier`, `eslint-config-prettier`
        *   `prettier`
    *   **Configuration Files (to be created):**
        *   `webpack.config.js`
        *   `.eslintrc.json`
        *   `.prettierrc`
        *   `.prettierignore`
    *   **NPM Scripts (add to `package.json` `scripts`):**
        *   `"start"`: To run the application in development mode using webpack-dev-server.
        *   `"build"`: To create a production build.
        *   `"lint"`: To run ESLint across the codebase.
        *   `"lint:fix"`: To automatically fix linting errors.
        *   `"format"`: To format code using Prettier.
