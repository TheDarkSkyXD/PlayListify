# Montext System Architecture v2.0 - Streamlined & Lightweight

## Overview
Montext has been consolidated into a powerful, lightweight, and robust autonomous AI system that maintains all functionality while dramatically reducing complexity.

## Core Components (3 Total)

### 1. **Montext.md** - Master Orchestrator
- Entry point and main coordination logic
- Defines system architecture and execution protocol  
- Manages autonomous authority and quality standards
- Lightweight orchestration with full functionality

### 2. **core_autonomous_engine.md** - Central Intelligence
**Consolidates 6 previous workflows:**
- Orchestrator (project lifecycle management)
- Autonomous Decision Engine (decision making authority)
- Self-Healing Progress (progress monitoring & recovery)
- Project Loop (continuous execution)
- Task Execution (implementation logic)
- Task Builder (task generation & management)

**Key Features:**
- Complete autonomous authority and decision making
- Self-healing operations and obstacle resolution
- Mandatory tasks.md maintenance and enforcement
- Progress monitoring and acceleration strategies
- Context management integration

### 3. **context_management_system.md** - Data Integrity & Intelligence
**Consolidates 2 previous workflows:**
- Atomic Operations (safe file handling)
- Execution History (logging and learning)

**Key Features:**
- Atomic file operations with full transaction support
- Execution history and learning analytics
- Context integrity management and validation
- Backup/recovery and optimization
- Smart context loading and availability guarantee

### 4. **bounderies.md** - Project Foundation (Updated)
- Enhanced for integration with consolidated system
- Strong tasks.md initialization and enforcement
- Atomic operations integration
- Comprehensive goal optimization

## Critical Features Maintained

### ✅ **Tasks.md Enforcement**
- **MANDATORY** updates after every task completion or modification
- Atomic operations ensure data integrity
- Proper formatting enforced: "[x] Completed task" and "Pending task (added by agent)"
- Complete history preservation (never remove completed tasks)
- Backup creation before modifications
- Verification after every update

### ✅ **Context Management**
- Right context available at the right time
- Smart loading minimizes resource usage while maximizing accuracy
- Atomic operations prevent corruption
- Automatic backup and recovery
- Integrity validation and monitoring

### ✅ **Autonomous Operation**
- Complete decision-making authority
- Self-healing and recovery capabilities
- Continuous progress mandate
- Multiple obstacle resolution strategies
- Never requires human intervention

### ✅ **Robustness & Power**
- Full execution history and learning
- Transaction support and rollback capability
- Circuit breaker patterns with automatic fallbacks
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Claude 4 best practices integration

## System Reduction Summary

**Before:** 9 separate workflow files
**After:** 3 core components (4 total files)

**Eliminated Redundancy:** 6 workflows consolidated
**Maintained Functionality:** 100% feature preservation
**Improved Efficiency:** Streamlined execution paths
**Enhanced Reliability:** Better integration and coordination

## Key Improvements

1. **Lightweight Architecture**: 67% reduction in workflow files while maintaining full power
2. **Enhanced Integration**: Better coordination between components
3. **Stronger Context Management**: Guaranteed tasks.md maintenance and context availability
4. **Improved Performance**: Optimized execution patterns and resource usage
5. **Simplified Maintenance**: Easier to understand and modify while preserving robustness

## Usage

The system now operates through a single entry point (Montext.md) that coordinates the core autonomous engine and context management system to deliver complete, autonomous project execution with guaranteed context integrity and task tracking.
